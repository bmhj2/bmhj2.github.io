Last week, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) published their [investigation report](https://ppo.gov.uk/news/ppo-publish-investigation-report-into-abuse-of-young-men-at-medomsley-detention-centre/) into historical abuse at Medomsley Detention Centre. The investigation, which followed multiple convictions of staff members for physical and sexual abuse of young men detained there between the 1960s and 1980s, received substantial media attention—including [coverage by the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdegpepg6n7o) and a [ministerial statement in Parliament](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-11-12/hcws1050). Caroline Lanskey and I were acknowledged in the report for our support to the investigation, and our 2018 research on safeguarding in youth custody was cited several times.

The original project, commissioned by HM Prison and Probation Service, examined the development of safeguards against mistreatment and abuse in places of child detention between 1960 and 2016. Working with a team of historians and criminologists, I conducted archival research at The National Archives and the Radzinowicz Library in Cambridge, tracing how institutions attempted—and often failed—to protect children in their care, triggering multiple cycles of reform. The project resulted in publications describing how the state's duty of care was understood and discharged, then and now, including [a report](/publications/jarmanSafeguardingChildrenSecure2018.qmd) and a [peer-reviewed article](/publications/jarmanPoorProspectIndeed2019.qmd) that Caroline and I wrote together.

In that article, we suggested that historical research has unique value in understanding why abuses can still occur in custody today, despite acknowledged improvements to the safeguarding framework. We argued that flaws in protective systems stem not just from policy design, but from deeper challenges around changing regulations, political disagreements over the purposes of custody, and fluctuating resource allocations. Archival records can paint a deceptively smooth and trouble-free picture of how institutions operated in the past, but examining them critically—informed by professional experience and other perspectives—reveals underlying conflicts. We suggested that historical examples might help practitioners think about their current working practices, noticing how these emerged from past political choices and encouraging reflection on contemporary risks.

## Engagement with Operation Deerness

When the PPO issued a call for evidence for what they had termed Operation Deerness, Caroline and I agreed that we would try and put together a [submission](/publications/jarmanSubmissionPPOsCall2024.qmd). It drew on our earlier research but also focused on methodological issues which had not been the main focus in our earlier publications, such as how we had identified and interpreted archival materials. We met Adrian Usher, the Ombudsman, in January 2025 to discuss the submission, and remained in contact with his team after that. We were subsequently sent a draft of the report and provided detailed comments.

Much of our overall contribution centred on helping the investigation team read historical documents "against the grain", and how to present the thorny issues associated with cultures (and policies) which have changed substantially over the long term—cultures which are often referred to simplistically as somehow 'explaining' things which happened in the past which we would find troubling or even unimaginable today.

It is hard to overstate the challenges of using archival materials to understand how institutions such as Medomsley operated, and to contextualise the survivor testimony about the abuses that happened there. Archival records often conceal as much as they reveal: what survives in them is not a full record of institutional life, but reflects the priorities of those who created and preserved them. This is a problem historians have noted using the metaphor of 'silences' to describe what archives systematically *exclude*. The archive is not a facsimile of institutional life, but a tiny, curated slice selected by people in positions of power. We offered strategies for reading documents critically, attending to what they reveal about broader cultures and assumptions rather than treating them simply as windows onto past events.

In a sense, our input to the investigation was simply to reflect on how we had navigated these challenges in our own research. But we were also aware that the PPO's team would be able to access closed archival materials that we were unable to obtain. Because they intended to interview survivors and other witnesses, they could potentially build on and add to our insights. This, we felt, made it important to contribute to the process.

## Reflections on accountability and justice

The report's publication represents an important step in documenting what happened at Medomsley and acknowledging the experiences of those who suffered there. Yet it is also important to recognise its limitations. As [The Guardian's reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/12/abuse-ignored-medomsley-detention-centre-prolific-sex-offender-young-men-neville-husband) notes, some survivors' groups had long since disassociated themselves from the PPO investigation, which fell short of their calls for a public inquiry with powers to compel witnesses.

In our 2019 article, Caroline and I drew on a small body of work on the victimology of state crimes, to reflect that criminal prosecutions—however important—represent an inadequate framework for justice in cases of institutional child abuse. Prosecutions hold the most blameworthy state agents accountable for the most egregious results of broader crimes of omission by the state, but they fail to reflect the scope and depth of the harms suffered by victims and survivors. They allow the framers of policy to disavow responsibility and deflect blame onto their subordinates—a process made easier by the passage of time.

The PPO investigation, while more comprehensive than individual prosecutions, still operates within constraints that may limit its capacity to deliver the justice some survivors sought. It has documented what happened and identified failings—and prompted an overdue, though largely symbolic [apology](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-11-12/hcws1050 "Medomsley Detention Centre: Statement made on 12 November 2025") to Medomsley survivors by the current government. I'm proud to have contributed to making the PPO's report as strong as it could be within these constraints, but I'm conscious it may not represent the full accountability many survivors expected.

## The value of historical research

This unexpected application of our earlier work—long after its apparent completion—demonstrates something important about academic research. Historical inquiry does not necessarily produce 'generalisable findings' that point to 'gaps' in policy which can be 'filled' to rule out future abuse. The past is too complex and contingent for such straightforward lessons.

What historical research can offer is perspective: a capacity to provoke reflection and to reveal that familiar, taken-for-granted aspects of contemporary practice are historically contingent consequences of past political choices. It can help practitioners and policymakers think critically about how they wield power, about the intended and unintended harms they might do with it, about the responsibilities they incur, and about the principles worth struggling for.

Working with the PPO investigation team has reinforced my belief in the value of bringing historical and contemporary perspectives into dialogue—not to produce simple 'lessons learned,' but to foster the kind of critical, reflective practice that might prevent future harms. If this work contributes in some small way to that end, it will have been worthwhile.
