<meta name="citation_abstract" content="This paper draws on qualitative data from interviews with men serving life sentences for murder to explore their experiences of parole decision-making processes. Whilst research on parole decisions has historically focused on the oral hearing as a discrete event, this paper offers a preliminary investigation into how prisoners perceive and navigate the broader administrative processes that shape parole outcomes. Drawing on an understanding of parole as a &amp;amp;#039;social process' (Tata, 2020) rather than a singular decision point, the paper will consider how prisoners interpret and respond to the compilation of their parole dossiers, their perceptions of risk assessment procedures, and the ways in which their lived experiences are translated by the parole dossier to become evidence of manageable or unmanageable risk, for consideration by the Parole Board. Through this consideration, the paper will reflect on questions regarding power, legitimacy and agency at the intersection of punishment and risk management.">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The decision-making process at parole reviews (indeterminate imprisonment for public protection sentences);,citation_abstract=Research was undertaken by the Ministry of Justice and the Parole Board on the decision-making process at parole reviews of indeterminate sentence prisoners. It involved the analysis of data collected from parole dossiers (used at parole reviews) and from interviews with Parole Board members. This summary presents high-level initial findings for prisoners serving indeterminate sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). A statistical analysis of data from 255 dossiers, and thematic analysis of 20 interviews with Parole Board members are presented. The number of interviews was small, and while respondents were carefully selected to reflect a range of experience they cannot be assumed to be statistically representative of Parole Board members as a whole.;,citation_author=Siân Bradford;,citation_author=Paul Cowell;,citation_publication_date=2012-02;,citation_cover_date=2012-02;,citation_year=2012;,citation_isbn=9781840995206;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=Ministry of Justice / Parole Board;,citation_technical_report_number=1/12;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Parole as a boxing match: Lifers, prosecution, and the adversarial making of parole hearings;,citation_abstract=Despite being depicted as powerful actors, the work of the State’s representatives in parole hearings has to date remained largely invisible. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap through a qualitative analysis of the oral arguments of prosecutors in 130 lifers’ parole board hearings in Israel. The findings suggest that prosecutors construct lifers’ parole hearings as an adversarial, yet asymmetrical, “boxing match.” Three themes were unveiled: Prosecutors construct the lifers as worthy of re-censure; view the lifers as solely responsible for their parole release; and construct the lifers as inherently suspicious individuals. In conclusion, prosecutors’ parole work seems to be more a defense of their shared professional identity as crime fighters than a promotion of an individualized, inclusive, and future-oriented parole decision-making process.;,citation_author=Netanel Dagan;,citation_publication_date=2024-04;,citation_cover_date=2024-04;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/14624745231204476;,citation_issn=1462-4745;,citation_volume=26;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society-international Journal of Penology;,citation_publisher=SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How do parole board members in England and Wales construct decisions about whether to release perpetrators of intimate partner violence from prison?;,citation_abstract=Background Existing research explores Parole Board decision-making, but not specifically for perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV), a special case due to the gendered and secretive nature of IPV and the role of control in predicting reoffending. Aim To identify associations between case variables in England and Wales Parole Board decisions regarding perpetrators of IPV and explore how these variables help construct the decision. Methods Logistic regressions regarding decisions in a sample of all 137 male prisoners who had abused women and applied for release or progression to open conditions in England and Wales from April 2018 to September 2019, developed into latent class analyses. Thematic analyses of six interviews with Parole Board members about decision-making in IPV cases. Results Release decisions were strongly predicted by the recommendations of offender managers, offender supervisors and psychologists, mediated by the Parole Board’s confidence in their ability. Decisions were also significantly associated with custodial behaviour and attendance on courses, mediated by the Board’s confidence in the prisoner’s insight and honesty. Thematic analysis was both consistent with these findings and provided a context in which the associations could be understood. Conclusions The findings have implications for understanding the dynamics between professional decisions and the Parole Board’s decision; for the importance of offender managers demonstrating their expertise and ability to manage risk; for Parole Board members’ reflection and development; for academic research into IPV; and for those who have experienced IPV and are looking to understand parole decisions about their abuser.;,citation_author=Chris Dyke;,citation_author=Karen Schucan Bird;,citation_author=Carol Rivas;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1002/cbm.2183;,citation_issn=1471-2857;,citation_volume=30;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How do parole board members in England and Wales decide whether to release men who have perpetrated domestic violence against women?;,citation_abstract=This thesis uses a novel methodology to understand parole decisions about perpetrators of domestic violence in England and Wales as complex adaptive systems. It informs victims, parole board members, researchers, and policymakers about the nature of decisions for this group of offenders. Existing research examines correlations between case variables and the outcome of a hearing and explores the thought processes of board members. But no previous studies explored parole decisions specifically about perpetrators of domestic violence, and few have examined other parole decisions in England and Wales. This research examines the variables associated with a release decision for a prisoner whose sole or primary risk involves domestic violence, and the dynamics behind any associations. I explore whether the nature of domestic violence requires a specific approach to decision-making and whether this is reflected in the results. My novel use of a primary dataset of 137 parole decisions, coded from decision letters, draws on a positivist tradition, while my thematic analysis of 20 interviews with parole board members takes an interpretivist approach. I develop the data into a systems model of the parole decision. My findings show that recommendations from the offender supervisor, offender manager and especially the psychologist are such a strong predictor of the decision that they amount to an effective “veto” on release. Perpetrator programmes are important only insofar as an offender’s refusal to attend suggests a lack of insight. Parole boards are more concerned with risk manageability than risk level and are less likely to release offenders with a history of “less manageable” controlling behaviour. This research shows that parole boards are influenced by domestic violence research, by structural factors and nature of offending, and that the underlying variables associated with release as determined through the mixed methods analysis are subtly different to those they emphasise consciously.;,citation_author=Chris Dyke;,citation_publication_date=2022-04;,citation_cover_date=2022-04;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=UCL (University College London);">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Moral messages, ethical responses: Punishment and self-governance among men serving life sentences for murder;,citation_abstract=This PhD uses theoretical and conceptual resources from the anthropology of morality and ethics to explore moral communication in the contemporary life sentence, as seen through the ethical lives of men serving life sentences for murder. Empirically, it describes three things. First, moral communication *about murder*: what a conviction for this crime and the experience of imprisonment for life “said” to prisoners about who they were and whom they ought to become. Second, moral communication *within a life course*: how people with different pre-prison experiences reacted to the rupture in identity imposed by the sanction. Third, moral communication *through the language of risk*: an unclear (though dominant) medium which imposed demands some lifers found a comfortable “fit”, but others did not. These descriptions draw on interview and documentary data relating to forty-eight individuals: thirty in a long-term category-B prison, and eighteen in a category-D or “open” prison focused on resettlement. All serving mandatory life sentences for murder, they were otherwise a heterogeneous group: convicted in diverse circumstances, aged from their teens to their seventies, and sentenced between 1983 and 2017. Their minimum terms ranged in length from less than ten to thirty years, and they had served between 7% and 250% of these minimums. Both in their backgrounds and in their custodial experiences, then, they formed a broad and diverse sample, affording a wide range of perspectives on the theoretical and substantive questions addressed by the research. The PhD adds theoretical depth and empirical detail to a growing literature on experiences of long-term and life imprisonment. It also comments on some implications of this empirical material for how retributive penal theorists have understood the *aims* of punishment—in particular, whether long-term imprisonment succeeds in communicating to prisoners what is *wrong* (as opposed to merely *harmful*) about taking life. It argues, overall, that the mandatory life sentence as currently delivered is a morally incoherent sanction. On the one hand, it is too individualised to convey clear moral norms or to show meaningful solidarity with those harmed and wronged by murders. On the other, it is not individualised enough to communicate effectively with murderers about the ethical responses that their actions might warrant.;,citation_author=Ben Jarman;,citation_publication_date=2024-06;,citation_cover_date=2024-06;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.17863/CAM.109063;,citation_language=en-GB;,citation_dissertation_institution=Apollo - University of Cambridge repository;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mass supervision, misrecognition and the “Malopticon”;,citation_abstract=This paper aims to contribute to debates about “mass supervision” by exploring its penal character as a lived experience. It begins with a review of recent studies that have used ethnographic methods to explore how supervision is experienced before describing the two projects (“Supervisible” and “Mass Supervision: Seen and Heard”) on which the paper draws, explaining these as an attempt to generate a “counter-visual criminology” of mass supervision. I then describe two encounters with “Teejay”; encounters in which we explored his experiences of supervision firstly through photography and then through song-writing. Both media are presented alongside Teejay’s commentary on what he sought to convey, inviting the reader to engage with and interpret the pictures and song. In the concluding discussion, I offer my own analysis, arguing that Teejay’s representations suggest a need to recognize mass supervision as “Maloptical” as much as “Panoptical”. Through the “Malopticon”, the penal subject is seen badly, is seen as bad and is projected and represented as bad. Experiences of misrecognition and misrepresentation constitute significant yet poorly understood pains of supervisory punishment. The paper concludes by suggesting several ways in which a counter-visual criminology might follow Teejay’s lead in exposing and challenging of mass supervision.;,citation_author=Fergus McNeill;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474518755137;,citation_issn=1462-4745;,citation_volume=21;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond the Tariff: Human Rights and the Release of Life Sentence Prisoners;,citation_abstract=This book is a study of the workings of the Discretionary Lifer Panels of the Parole Board, the body charged with the responsibility for making decisions on the release of discretionary life sentence prisoners. It traces the origins and development of the Discretionary Lifer Panels following the landmark Weeks and Thynne decisions of the European Court of Human Rights which led to the establishment of DLPs, and examines the way in which the DLPs developed subsequently - often rather differently to what was originally envisaged as necessary to comply with the decision of the ECHR. This book provides a fascinating case study of a little-known part of the criminal justice system, and explores at the same time the wider issues that have arisen - in particular the impact of the ECHR and the Human Rights Act on the criminal justice system; the relationship between the Parole Board and the Prison and Probation Services; the differences between release procedures for different categories of life sentence prisoner, and those detained compulsorily under the Mental Health Act;the broader social, legal and political context in which DLPs operate, and the nature of discretionary decision-making in the criminal justice system field. the first detailed study - from a leading authority in the field - of the way decisions are reached on discretionary life sentence prisoners explores the impact of the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the Human Rights Act on the working of the criminal justice system of interest to practitioners and academics concerned with the criminal justice system.;,citation_author=Nicola Padfield;,citation_publication_date=2002;,citation_cover_date=2002;,citation_year=2002;,citation_isbn=978-1-84392-423-4;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Communication repair in parole oral hearings: Comparing remote and in-person settings;,citation_abstract=The Parole Board (PB) for England and Wales is responsible for deciding whether prisoners are safe to be released into the community. Although the PB was using remote formats (teleconferencing and videoconferencing) to conduct hearings prior to 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated the wider application of remote hearings. Such changes in modality can have a significant impact on interactional practices, with participation in remote communication requiring a different set of skills from those normally involved in in-person interaction. We argue that this shift in modality is important because it risks impeding prisoners’ participation in hearings and may limit the legitimacy of a parole hearing decision when examined through the lens of procedural justice theory. In this article, we draw on a dataset of 30 recordings of in-person and remote oral hearings. We analyse sections in which prisoners are questioned by PB panel members to identify whether these interactions can be deemed to be as successful in remotely held hearings as compared with in-person hearings. To assess this, we compare instances of communication problems that occur in the datasets. Applying conversation analysis, we find that instances of repair work from participants are statistically more likely to be present in remote hearings when compared to in-person settings.

He reveals the vivid and illuminating contrast between two worlds of work: the vanished world of rigid, hierarchical organizations, where what mattered was a sense of personal character, and the brave new world of corporate re-engineering, risk, flexibility, networking, and short-term teamwork, where what matters is being able to reinvent yourself on a dime. In this timely and essential essay, Sennett enables us to understand the social and political context for our contemporary confusions, and he suggests how we need to re-imagine both community and individual character in order to confront an economy based on the principle of &amp;amp;amp;quot;no long term.&amp;quot;;,citation_author=Richard Sennett;,citation_publication_date=1998;,citation_cover_date=1998;,citation_year=1998;,citation_isbn=978-0-393-07852-7;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Perils of Parole Hearings: California Lifers, Performative Disadvantage, and the Ideology of Insight;,citation_abstract=Abstract Following a series of transformative political and legal battles, California’s overcrowded prison system has moved in the direction of moderate decarceration. A softer stance on punishment means that thousands of previously ineligible inmates serving indeterminate sentences are now being considered for release on parole. Drawing on ethnographic observations of twenty parole hearings in one California men’s prison, this study outlines how rehabilitation has come to be enmeshed in a logic of punitivity, as parole commissioners subject inmates to an individualizing gaze that misrecognizes the socially embedded nature of their performance. Parole commissioners are tasked with assessing dangerousness, deploying a multifaceted conception of risk that combines formalized actuarial instruments and evaluative judgments to form the inchoate and contradictory notion of ?insight.? Inmates are expected to demonstrate this if they are to be released, but what is insight? Parole boards assume that it is a valid indicator of future behavior and probable recidivism, and parole commissioners posit that successful inmates will be capable of demonstrating authentic remorse and insight, unimpeded by the constraints of an austere and dangerous carceral environment. However, the discretionary criteria established by the penal system are limited by the deleterious living conditions established by this same penal system.;,citation_author=Victor L.

The papers that follow respond to a “think-piece” presented by Richard Sparks at that event, and engage with the subsequent debate about the future of funding for crime and justice research. Contributors reflect on the opportunities and challenges arising from recent shifts in funding allocations and priorities, from their different vantage points. Highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary and international work, they consider priorities for future investment in crime and justice research and draw attention to the impact of an increasingly restrictive and risk-averse climate on critical research. The papers explore the consequences for criminology as a discipline and warn of the potential reinforcement of existing inequalities in academia unless action is taken to support the development of future researchers.;,citation_author=Richard Sparks;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1748895820949297;,citation_issn=1748-8958, 1748-8966;,citation_volume=20;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminology &amp;amp; Criminal Justice;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">

      <p>This paper draws on qualitative data from interviews with men serving life sentences for murder to explore their experiences of parole decision-making processes. Whilst research on parole decisions has historically focused on the oral hearing as a discrete event, this paper offers a preliminary investigation into how prisoners perceive and navigate the broader administrative processes that shape parole outcomes. Drawing on an understanding of parole as a ‘social process’ <span class="citation" data-cites="tataSentencingSocialProcess2020">(<a href="#ref-tataSentencingSocialProcess2020" role="doc-biblioref">Tata 2020</a>)</span> rather than a singular decision point, the paper will consider how prisoners interpret and respond to the compilation of their parole dossiers, their perceptions of risk assessment procedures, and the ways in which their lived experiences are translated by the parole dossier to become evidence of manageable or unmanageable risk, for consideration by the Parole Board. Through this consideration, the paper will reflect on questions regarding power, legitimacy and agency at the intersection of punishment and risk management.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This paper bridges past and future research. My PhD analysed how men serving life sentences for murder navigate moral questions and institutional demands for risk reduction. I used interviews and prison documents to explore these questions with 48 men held in two English prisons, in 2019 and early 2020.</p>
<p>Twenty-six of them were approaching or had passed their tariff dates, placing them in scope for parole decisions—a term I’m using broadly to encompass not just oral hearings, but the wider apparatus of sentence planning, risk assessment, and dossier compilation. This reflects how participants themselves saw the decision: as the result of a process, not an event, and in which they did not always differentiate clearly between the roles of the Prison Service and the Parole Board.</p>
<p>Though parole remains under-researched <span class="citation" data-cites="sparksCrimeJusticeResearch2020">(<a href="#ref-sparksCrimeJusticeResearch2020" role="doc-biblioref">Sparks 2020</a>)</span>, recent interest is growing.

A consistent finding, both from quantitative studies which note strong correlations, and observational studies of parole board panellists’ thinking, is that the pre-hearing stages of the process strongly shape the eventual decision <span class="citation" data-cites="hoodParoleSystemWork2000 dykeHowParoleBoard2020 padfieldParoleBoardOral2017 bradfordDecisionmakingProcessParole2012 powerReleaseNotRelease2018 finnisFormidableDocumentFailure2017">(<a href="#ref-bradfordDecisionmakingProcessParole2012" role="doc-biblioref">Bradford &amp; Cowell 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-dykeHowParoleBoard2020" role="doc-biblioref">Dyke <em>et al.</em> 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-finnisFormidableDocumentFailure2017" role="doc-biblioref">Finnis 2017</a>; e.g. <a href="#ref-hoodParoleSystemWork2000" role="doc-biblioref">Hood &amp; Shute 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-padfieldParoleBoardOral2017" role="doc-biblioref">Padfield 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-powerReleaseNotRelease2018" role="doc-biblioref">Power 2018</a>)</span>. But the pre-hearing stages remain under-explored: our view of <em>how</em> work by prison staff shapes the decision is dated, and there’s very little available on decision-making in the roughly 45% of all cases that are concluded on the papers. We know <em>that</em> it does, but not <em>how</em> they interpret evidence, understand risk, or prioritise competing considerations.</p>
<p>Given these gaps in our understanding, today I’ll describe three themes from re-analysing those 26 interviews: temporal disruption, procedural expectations, and performativity. These represent a rough-and-ready exploration whilst I develop new research—offered to stimulate discussion, not as any last word.</p>
<p>After covering these themes, I’ll draw together some threads and relate them to the new research I’ve got in the pipeline; and in the discussion at the end, I’d love to hear what resonates with you.</p>
</section>
<section id="temporal-disruption-the-parole-process-and-lived-time" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="temporal-disruption-the-parole-process-and-lived-time">Temporal disruption: the parole process and lived time</h2>
<p>My first theme relates to time. Entering the parole process appeared to disrupt participants’ experience of time, reactivating past events and future possibilities in ways that were often disorienting.</p>
<p>The 26 men I’m focusing on had served an average of 17 years. For most, there had been long stretches of what some called ‘dead time’ or ‘stagnation’. They felt warehoused by a system that expected little from them. Then the parole process changed everything: unsettling the past; making the future more uncertain (and yet more appealing); and puitting them into a cycle of increased urgency and fresh delay.</p>
<p>The relevant past suddenly expanded beyond the original offence to encompass years of documented custodial behaviour. Participants found themselves blindsided when long-dormant incidents acquired fresh significance through risk assessment—often resurfacing on paper, without interview or context. Billy had served around ten years and had believed that he was in good shape to progress to an open prison, when a Prison Offender Manager told him that he should have been given a full psychological assessment, something which Billy believed could add conditions to his progression. The POM had admitted, he said, that “we forgot you. You’ve gone through the system and you’ve been forgotten.”</p>
<p>As to the future: a new version of it comes into view when the parole window kicks in. It is a profoundly uncertain future, yet also an intensely appealing one, if the alternative is more prison time. Often, the uncertainties related to whether they were, in fact, in good standing regarding their sentence plan objectives. Ebo expressed frustration that his many years of effort to “put [him]self in a good position” were captured neither by prison files, nor by any contact between him and report writers.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, some participants welcomed impending reviews as they could prompt OMUs to address neglected casework, though assessment by unfamiliar staff carried risks</p>
<p>External circumstances compounded uncertainty. Some faced serious health problems or bereavement, desperate to see family while still possible. As Tom said: “[I just want to] get it over and done with […] I just want to know […] All this time [since the last assessment] is limbo.”</p>
<p>As some of these quotes suggest, some participants were increasingly perceiving time as cyclical, not linear. Fred, who was 15 years over tariff and waiting for what would be his seventh hearing, felt as if he was on the verge of disengaging entirely, instead of remaining trapped in this cycle: “I’ve had enough of this bullshit and dickering around and I’m going to get to the stage where [I say] ‘That’s YOUR parole board. I’m not even engaging. Just leave me alone.’ […] They keep dangling the carrot, and just as I get to the carrot, they hit you with a fucking stick.”</p>
<p>This temporal disorientation gives past actions new significance whilst future possibilities feel simultaneously urgent and illusory. Having experienced years of ‘nothing time’ in which they felt they had been ignored, being up for review caused many of these men to reflect on what was under scrutiny. Those who were approaching their first few reviews, and did not yet feel trapped in the cycle, often expressed hopes for a particular kind of recognition.</p>
</section>
<section id="procedural-expectations-risk-assessment-vs.-moral-evaluation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedural-expectations-risk-assessment-vs.-moral-evaluation">Procedural expectations: risk assessment vs.&nbsp;moral evaluation</h2>
<p>What they discovered in practice was a tension between expectation and reality. My second theme relates to expectations of the process. Administratively, a parole review is a risk assessment—nothing more, nothing less. It decides only whether continued incarceration is necessary to protect the public. But the Board’s ‘court-like’ functions mean that it also exercises sentencing powers <span class="citation" data-cites="padfieldTariffHumanRights2002">(<a href="#ref-padfieldTariffHumanRights2002" role="doc-biblioref">Padfield 2002</a>)</span>. Its decisions inevitably communicate something normative, raising questions—within prisons and among the wider public—about the moral justifications for punishment, and about who ‘deserves’ freedom. Many participants expected the parole process to engage in this kind of evaluation, and they mostly discovered that it did not.</p>
<p>Most participants narrated significant personal change after an average of 17 years inside. While earlier-stage prisoners often used language recognisable from cognitive behavioural programmes, those approaching release described deeper shifts in <em>character</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="sennettCorrosionCharacterPersonal1998">(<a href="#ref-sennettCorrosionCharacterPersonal1998" role="doc-biblioref">Sennett 1998</a>)</span>—that is, long-term changes in their emotional priorities. Daniel reflected on this in relation to a growing sense of interdependency. Jeff simply said: “I didn’t know then that I could be kind to people, you know?” And Grant remarked that though his beliefs had not changed, his willingness to inflict them on others had lessened over time.</p>
<p>Though these quotes might describe something very real about the person, they don’t necessarily translate easily into the language of risk. Participants sometimes approached parole hearings expecting that these broader changes in character would be taken into account, but then found the process focused tightly on more technical risk indicators. To put this bluntly, risk assessments are not necessarily interested in personal transformations in character. Frank remarked on how much of a recent hearing had been taken up with discussing a pain relief prescription.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They were so intent on the fact that [I’ve been prescribed codeine] for pain […] They spent maybe even half an hour talking about it, which is [more than] they talked about the crime I committed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The focus on codeine was justified by Frank’s history of opiate abuse. Yet he seemed bemused by the relative neglect of his changing feelings about the lives lost through his offence—a misrecognition <span class="citation" data-cites="mcneillMassSupervisionMisrecognition2019">(<a href="#ref-mcneillMassSupervisionMisrecognition2019" role="doc-biblioref">McNeill 2019</a>)</span> captured when the Board told him:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What the Parole Board did say, was, we don’t focus on the positives, because they’re a given. We’re here to focus on the negatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t exactly that a risk focus was seen as illegitimate. Grant insisted that having killed his wife, there was “absolutely no way I’ll get into a future relationship”, but his proposed licence conditions included a disclosure requirement if he did, and he accepted this, saying, “of course there’s a bloody increased risk”. But participants found dissonance between their moral frames and the process’s risk focus. Nicholas captured this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I understand that there is that risk… But I still believe that everybody should be treated as an individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I’m not trying to downplay the importance of risk assessment, these examples reveal how it also fails to recognise that lifers have often experienced personal change in a language and a register which doesn’t resonate with the risk paradigm. Learning that this disconnect exists, and learning (like Grant and Nicholas) to accept its demands, represented a performative challenge, and it’s performativity that’s my third theme.</p>
</section>
<section id="performativity-self-presentation-and-psychological-integrity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performativity-self-presentation-and-psychological-integrity">Performativity: self-presentation and psychological integrity</h2>
<p>Self-presentation emerged as a prominent theme, which I’ll discuss as performativity—acknowledging that performance implies an audience.</p>
<p>Given that parole involves release from prison, the incentives to perform are extremely powerful ones. As Taylor observed, “90% of us in this jail tell [parole boards] what they want to know.” But this represented a spectrum of different approaches. At one end stood Alf’s defensive minimalism: “I’m just going to say, ‘yes, sir. No, sir. Three bags full, sir.’” Quite similar was Nixon’s calculated compliance—engaging “because I had to” and being open on a “need to know basis”. At another extreme was Daniel’s commitment to full disclosure—“you just lay your soul bare”—though he and others identified personal costs such as retraumatisation, and there were also risks to offering up too much information. In the middle there were a range of sophisticated attempts to negotiate over the narrative: to perform manageable risk, while also carving out space for one’s own particular self-identity.</p>
<p>This was starkest among those maintaining innocence. Ian claimed innocence of murder yet accepted responsibility for managing risks portrayed in his dossier. When I asked about this contradiction Ian said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I’ve said I’m not proud of the way I was […] in relation to the affairs. I can openly admit, I said, “No-one deserves that, I wouldn’t want that for my daughters.” And it’s a matter then of just having the empathy, to the […] hurt and the pain that you’ve caused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a particularly striking example, but well illustrates the kinds of balancing act I am describing. So rather than suggesting a clear division between open/honest engagement on the one hand, and strategic/manipulative engagement on the other, what we actually see is something more nuanced, in which most participants were perform in line with what they thought assessors expected, while also trying to maintain a sense of psychological integrity with aspects of how they saw themselves and their biographies.</p>
<p>Those repeatedly knocked back showed different patterns. Chris, facing the possibility of a seventh or eighth knockback, adopted a self-destructive flippancy. Pressed repeatedly about encountering his co-defendant—“What if he follows you? What if he won’t go away?”—he finally snapped: “Well then I’ll fucking kill him!” adding bitterly, “that’s the answer he wanted.” Fred—in a similar position and who we heard earlier speaking of the carrot and the stick—offered another image to describe the stacked odds he perceived:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s like having a a pair of scales, yeah? And they’ve got a big weight already fucking tilting the scales on one side that says public protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I’m suggesting, again, is that for those who return to the process over and over again, performing a certain kind of selfhood and putting their hopes in the Board’s hands, there may be diminishing returns. Fred and Chris prioritised psychological and narrative integrity over continued engagement. As Derek, who at 35 years and counting was the longest-serving prisoner in my whole sample, remarked: “It’s the hope that kills you”.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-directions-beyond-prisoner-testimony" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-directions-beyond-prisoner-testimony">Future directions: beyond prisoner testimony</h2>
<p>How do decision-makers perceive different presentational styles? Do <em>they</em> recognise performative compliance, and if so, how do they interpret it in making their assessments? How do prisoners fare who cannot find psychologically sustainable ways of engaging with risk frameworks?</p>
<p>Observing that prisoners are frustrated and feel objectified by risk assessment isn’t groundbreaking. But prisoner interviews alone can’t explain why these patterns emerge. Despite parole’s considerable impact, the dossier preparation process has never been observed in depth. Without understanding how dossiers are compiled—under what constraints, with what priorities—we cannot distinguish between administrative carelessness, resource limitations, and fundamental problems.</p>
<p>There are critical issues that prisoner accounts alone cannot illuminate. Given serious staffing pressures and shortages of experienced OMU staff, who receives genuinely individualised assessment? How do staff weigh different forms of evidence? When Frank’s hearing focused more on his codeine prescription than his expressions of remorse, why was that? Understanding these patterns requires triangulating prisoner testimonies with staff interviews, observational data, and documentary evidence.</p>
<p>The research I’m developing therefore examines the parole decision as a socially situated process <span class="citation" data-cites="tataSentencingSocialProcess2020">(see <a href="#ref-tataSentencingSocialProcess2020" role="doc-biblioref">Tata 2020</a>)</span> to which many different people contribute—not as the product of a single decision-making event. It will be a mixed-methods study combining quantitative analysis of Parole Board documents with ethnographic work following individual cases through the parole process.</p>
<p>The quantitative component will code a dataset from Parole Board documents, and then analyse associations between dossier data points and parole outcomes relating to prisoners held at specific sites. The qualitative component will follow 25-30 cases at the same sites longitudinally, through interviews, observation, and document analysis.</p>
<p>Triangulating these perspectives should illuminate how resource constraints shape assessment, what drives staff priorities, and how strategic presentations are perceived. I’ve just received ethics clearance, and submitted access applications to the Parole Board and HMPPS last week. I hope to start data collection later this year.</p>
<p>This matters because parole decisions carry enormous symbolic weight and practical consequences—shaping prison populations, communicating societal values, affecting individual lives. Understanding them as complex institutional processes rather than discrete events is essential for meaningful improvement. I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p>

    men serving life sentences for murder to explore their experiences
    of parole decision-making processes. Whilst research on parole
    decisions has historically focused on the oral hearing as a discrete
    event, this paper offers a preliminary investigation into how
    prisoners perceive and navigate the broader administrative processes
    that shape parole outcomes. Drawing on an understanding of parole as
    a “social process” (Tata, 2020) rather than a singular decision
    point, the paper will consider how prisoners interpret and respond
    to the compilation of their parole dossiers, their perceptions of
    risk assessment procedures, and the ways in which their lived
    experiences are translated by the parole dossier to become evidence
    of manageable or unmanageable risk, for consideration by the Parole
    Board. Through this consideration, the paper will reflect on
    questions regarding power, legitimacy and agency at the intersection
    of punishment and risk management.}
