    Ensuring open data and open science in changing times remains a priority for
    publicly funded social science research in the UK. Understanding the
    changing landscape is key to achieving this and implementing it through
    appropriate policies and practices.

  abstract: >-
    Criminology produces policy-relevant research and criminologists often seek
    to influence practice, but most criminological research is confined to
    expensive subscription journals. This disadvantages researchers in the
    global south, policy makers and practitioners who have the skills to use
    research findings but do not have journal subscriptions. Open access seeks
    to increase availability of research, but take-up among criminologists has
    been low. This study used a sample of 12,541 articles published in
    criminology journals between 2017 and 2019 to estimate the proportion of
    articles available via different types of open access. Overall 22% of
    research was available to non-subscribers, about half that found in other
    disciplines, even though authors had the right to make articles open without
    payment in at least 95% of cases. Open access was even less common in many
    leading journals and among researchers in the United States. Open access has
    the potential to increase access to research for those outside academia, but
    few scholars exercise their existing rights to distribute freely the
    submitted or accepted versions of their articles online. Policies to
    incentivise authors to make research open access where possible are needed
    unlock the benefits of greater access to criminological research.

    Fostering cultures of open qualitative research: Final Project Report This
    report was created and deposited onto the University of Sheffield Online
    Research Data repository (ORDA) on 14-Dec-2023 by Dr. Matthew S. Hanchard,
    Research Associate at the University of Sheffield iHuman Institute. The
    report presents findings and recommendations from a project titled
    ‘Fostering cultures of open qualitative research’ which ran from January
    2023 to June 2023. The project was funded with £13,913.85 of Research
    England monies held internally by the University of Sheffield - as part of
    their ‘Enhancing Research Cultures’ scheme 2022-2023. Research within the
    report aligns with ethical approval granted by the University of Sheffield
    School of Sociological Studies Research Ethics Committee (ref: 051118) on
    23-Jan-2021.This includes due concern for participant anonymity and data
    management. ORDA has full permission to store and make available datasets
    and reports from the project for public viewing and reuse on the basis that
    no commercial gain will be made from reuse. It has been deposited under a

  abstract: >-
    Qualitative researchers are expected, sometimes required, to publish their
    data open access (OA). This is for the sake of science, impact, and social
    justice. Yet, understandably, qualitative criminologists are worried about
    what this means for their workload and their ability to protect subjects’
    confidentiality. To be solutions-oriented, we developed an open-source
    Python script for anonymizing qualitative data. It uses named-entity
    recognition and fuzzy-rule based merging to identify and replace personally
    identifiable information (PII) with unique pseudonyms. This tool doesn’t
    eliminate the need for manual work, but it reduces the cost and associated
    risk. In this article, we describe and explain how our script works and how
    to use it. We conclude by discussing the implications for open (qualitative)
    criminology.

    There is strong support for the open research agenda among qualitative
    researchers. This report broadly defines qualitative research as the
    exploration of communities’ and individuals’ perspectives and lived
    experiences and how people meaningfully construct and negotiate social
    worlds in specific contexts. Such research typically involves
    natural-language descriptions, rather than numerical measurements. However,
    University advocates of open research and funders’ open research policies
    tend to frame key tenets and desired outcomes in terms of the priorities,
    methodological approaches and quality markers of STEMM fields and the
    quantitative social sciences. Qualitative research is heterogeneous, and
    STEMM-oriented open-data policies can be at odds with qualitative
    researchers’ values. Instead of building trust and transparency into the
    research process, such policies can undermine or inhibit collaboration and
    engagement that are crucial for ongoing qualitative work. Nevertheless, many
    qualitative researchers – and we as a working group – feel that open
    research presents huge opportunities for innovation in our fields and,
    therefore, hope to make discussions about open research at Cambridge
    University more inclusive of qualitative researchers’ viewpoints. This
    report includes a number of concrete recommendations that respond to the
    dialogic, emergent, abundant and relational aspects of qualitative research
    by proposing context-specific guidelines, infrastructures and training
    resources.

  abstract: >-
    There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse
    of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia,
    industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to
    design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that
    we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as
    a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data
    holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar,
    the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of
    machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting
    its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of
    the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some
    exemplar implementations in the community.
