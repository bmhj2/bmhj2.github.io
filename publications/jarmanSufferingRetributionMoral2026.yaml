    Based on a longitudinal study of life-sentenced prisoners in England and
    Wales, this article seeks to make sense of what it characterizes as
    ‘sedative coping’. In doing so, it brings together analytic conclusions from
    the existing research literature that appear highly inconsistent, but which
    indicate the centrality of emotion in the experience of serving a long
    prison sentence. Specifically, it highlights the forms of emotion management
    and suppression involved in coping with the trauma of such circumstances,
    and the post-release impact of sustained forms of emotional
    self-preservation. This focus helps us better understand the connection
    between ‘mature coping’ in custody and the post-release difficulties that
    life-sentenced prisoners often describe.

  abstract: >-
    Given the increasing number of prisoners serving life sentences in England
    and Wales, and the increasing average length of these sentences, it is
    surprising that so little attention has been paid to the experiences and
    effects of such sanctions. This article describes how prisoners serving very
    long sentences from an early age adapt over time to their circumstances. In
    particular, it focuses on the transition between the early and subsequent
    stages of such sentences, specifically, the ways that these prisoners adapt
    to the sentence, manage time, come to terms with their offense, shift their
    conception of control, make their sentence constructive, and find wider
    meaning in and from their predicament. Our argument is that most prisoners
    demonstrate a shift from a form of agency that is reactive to one that is
    productive, as they learn to “swim with”, rather than against, the tide of
    their situation.

  abstract: >-
    Prison scholarship has tended to focus on the pains and frustrations that
    result from the use and over-use of penal power. Yet the absence of such
    power and the subjective benefits of its grip are also worthy of attention.
    This article begins by drawing on recent literature and research findings to
    develop the concept of ‘tightness’ beyond its initial formulation. Drawing
    primarily on data from a study of men convicted of sex offences, it goes on
    to explain that, in some circumstances, the reach and hold of penal power
    are not experienced as oppressive and undesirable, and, indeed, may be
    welcomed. Conversely, institutional inattention and an absence of grip may
    be experienced as painful. Prisons, then, can be ‘loose’ or ‘lax’ as well as
    ‘tight’. The article then discusses the different ways in which prisons
    exercise grip, and, in doing so, recognise or misrecognise the subjectivity
    of the individual prisoner. It concludes by identifying the connections
    between this ‘ground-up’ analysis of the relative legitimacy of different
    forms of penal intervention and recent discussions in penal theory about the
    proper role of the state in communicating censure and promoting personal
    repentance and change.

  abstract: >-
    The question "What can justify criminal punishment ?" becomes especially
    insistent at times, like our own, of penal crisis, when serious doubts are
    raised not only about the justice or efficacy of particular modes of
    punishment, but about the very legitimacy of the whole penal system. Recent
    theorizing about punishment offers a variety of answers to that
    question-answers that try to make plausible sense of the idea that
    punishment is justified as being deserved for past crimes; answers that try
    to identify some beneficial consequences in terms of which punishment might
    be justified; as well as abolitionist answers telling us that we should seek
    to abolish, rather than to justify, criminal punishment. This book begins
    with a critical survey of recent trends in penal theory, but goes on to
    develop an original account (based on Duff's earlier Trials and Punishments)
    of criminal punishment as a mode of moral communication, aimed at inducing
    repentance, reform, and reconciliation through reparation-an account that
    undercuts the traditional controversies between consequentialist and
    retributivist penal theories, and that shows how abolitionist concerns can
    properly be met by a system of communicative punishments. In developing this
    account, Duff articulates the "liberal communitarian" conception of
    political society (and of the role of the criminal law) on which it depends;
    he discusses the meaning and role of different modes of punishment, showing
    how they can constitute appropriate modes of moral communication between
    political community and its citizens; and he identifies the essential
    preconditions for the justice of punishment as thus conceived-preconditions
    whose non-satisfaction makes our own system of criminal punishment morally
    problematic. Punishment, Communication, and Community offers no easy
    answers, but provides a rich and ambitious ideal of what criminal punishment
    could be-an ideal of what criminal punishment cold be-and ideal that
    challenges existing penal theories as well as our existing penal theories as
    well as our existing penal practices.

  type: book

- id: duffRetrievingRetributivism2011
  abstract: >-
    This chapter offers new perspectives on his position that punishment
    communicates the censure that the offender deserves for his crime, focusing
    on the challenge of explaining why penal “hard treatment” should be the
    appropriate means of communication. The chapter meets that challenge by
    showing that appropriate kinds of penal hard treatment can serve as a
    vehicle for a two-way communication between offender and political
    community—the communication of formal censure from community to offender,
    and of formally apologetic recognition from offender to community—which is
    motivated by the offender’s wrongdoing as ascertained during a fair trial,
    which Duff emphasizes as critical to the retributivist project. This chapter
    goes beyond the author's last book in developing the “apology” dimension and
    saying more about the relationship between retributive and restorative
    justice, bringing together ideas from some of the work that he has published
    since then (most in relatively obscure publications).

    What ends do we expect and hope to serve in punishing criminal wrongdoers?
    Does the punishment of offenders do more harm than good for American
    society? In The Case against Punishment, Deirdre Golash addresses these and
    other questions about the value of punishment in contemporary society.
    Drawing on both empirical evidence and philosophical literature, this book
    argues that the harm done by punishing criminal offenders is ultimately
    morally unjustified. Asserting that punishment inflicts both intended and
    unintended harms on offenders, Golash suggests that crime can be reduced by
    addressing social problems correlated with high crime rates, such as income
    inequality and local social disorganization. Punishment may reduce crime,
    but in so doing, causes a comparable amount of harm to offenders. Instead,
    Golash suggests, we should address criminal acts through trial, conviction,
    and compensation to the victim, while also providing the criminal with the
    opportunity to reconcile with society through morally good action rather
    than punishment.

  abstract: >-
    Drawing on an amended version of a survey employed in three previous
    studies, this article reports the problems experienced by 294 male prisoners
    serving very long life sentences received when aged 25 or under. The broad
    findings are consistent with previous work, including few differences being
    found between the problems experienced as most and least severe by prisoners
    at different sentence stages. By grouping the problems into conceptual
    dimensions, and by drawing on interviews conducted with 126 male prisoners,
    we seek to provide a more nuanced analysis of this pattern. We argue that,
    while earlier scholars concluded that the effects of long-term confinement
    were not ‘cumulative’ and ‘deleterious’, adaptation to long-term
    imprisonment has a deep and profound impact on the prisoner, so that the
    process of coping leads to fundamental changes in the self, which go far
    beyond the attitudinal.

  abstract: >-
    Recent theorisations of adaptation to life imprisonment emphasise the role
    of moral and biographical reflection by people in prison. Using an analysis
    of a subsample from a larger study in England and Wales, composed of men
    serving life sentences imposed after their fortieth birthdays, this article
    suggests that they adapted themselves to the prison regime both more quickly
    and more pragmatically than their younger counterparts. It describes how
    their accounts of the index offence, which were often justificatory and
    sometimes victim-blaming, had often gone unchallenged because they were a
    low priority for intervention, and less motivated by working towards an
    (imagined) better future. These findings add nuance to recent work in prison
    sociology of adaptation to very long sentences.

  abstract: >-
    This PhD uses theoretical and conceptual resources from the anthropology of
    morality and ethics to explore moral communication in the contemporary life
    sentence, as seen through the ethical lives of men serving life sentences
    for murder. Empirically, it describes three things. First, moral
    communication *about murder*: what a conviction for this crime and the
    experience of imprisonment for life ‘said’ to prisoners about who they were
    and whom they ought to become. Second, moral communication *within a life
    course*: how people with different pre-prison experiences reacted to the
    rupture in identity imposed by the sanction. Third, moral communication
    *through the language of risk*: an unclear (though dominant) medium which
    imposed demands some lifers found a comfortable ‘fit’, but others did not.
    These descriptions draw on interview and documentary data relating to
    forty-eight individuals: thirty in a long-term category-B prison, and
    eighteen in a category-D or ‘open’ prison focused on resettlement. All
    serving mandatory life sentences for murder, they were otherwise a
    heterogeneous group: convicted in diverse circumstances, aged from their
    teens to their seventies, and sentenced between 1983 and 2017. Their minimum
    terms ranged in length from less than ten to thirty years, and they had
    served between 7% and 250% of these minimums. Both in their backgrounds and
    in their custodial experiences, then, they formed a broad and diverse
    sample, affording a wide range of perspectives on the theoretical and
    substantive questions addressed by the research. The PhD adds theoretical
    depth and empirical detail to a growing literature on experiences of
    long-term and life imprisonment. It also comments on some implications of
    this empirical material for how retributive penal theorists have understood
    the *aims* of punishment—in particular, whether long-term imprisonment
    succeeds in communicating to prisoners what is *wrong* (as opposed to merely
    *harmful*) about taking life. It argues, overall, that the mandatory life
    sentence as currently delivered is a morally incoherent sanction. On the one
    hand, it is too individualised to convey clear moral norms or to show
    meaningful solidarity with those harmed and wronged by murders. On the
    other, it is not individualised enough to communicate effectively with
    murderers about the ethical responses that their actions might warrant.

  abstract: >-
    Recent studies of long-term imprisonment describe a largely invariant
    pattern of prisoner adaptation. Using data from a qualitative study of men
    serving life sentences in England, I argue that adaptation may in fact vary
    more than these studies imply both because of the prisoner’s age when
    sentenced and because of the circumstances of particular offences.
    Participants’ engagement with the prison’s rehabilitative ‘offer’ depended
    on how the sentence affected their life course and what they understood to
    be the moral ramifications of the offence. These findings refine
    understanding of adaptation and suggest that a renewed focus on moral
    reflexivity may bear fruit in future prison research.

  abstract: >-
    This chapter proposes that the cumulative findings arising from several
    explorations of the quality and effects of prison life might be garnered to
    propose a "failed state" theory of prison functioning and effects. A failed
    state is identified by a number of social, economic, and political and
    military indicators. The chapter outlines how appreciative inquiry has taken
    one from stories about what prisoners are most proud of to a two-directional
    theory of the failed-state prison. It describes the transformative potential
    and power in social science research methodology. The term generative theory
    emerged from a critical tradition: a group of scholars seeking to challenge
    meaning systems and distributions of power, rather than from an appreciative
    perspective. Agenerative theory aims to promote the advancement and
    well-being of the population under specific study. It provides a framework
    for the building of virtues, or the good society in which the individual can
    flourish.

    I argue in this article that, far from being ‘policy advisors’, our main
    moral purpose in research is ‘getting the description right’. Doing this
    takes time, effort and energy. Good description constitutes what Ferrell and
    Hamm (1998) called ‘edgework’. It requires courage and skill, and an I‐Thou
    orientation toward our participants. The paradox, as Paul Rock (2014)
    suggests, is that whilst ‘policy change’ should not be the primary aim of
    criminological research, research done well can make poor policy choices, or
    ‘facile gestures’, less defensible, and can have impact on the world of
    practice in indirect as well as direct ways.

  abstract: >-
    An exploration of prison suicide can offer a variety of significant
    insights. It can help in the development of suicide prevention policy, but
    may also help in the broader understanding of the nature of prisons. There
    is an ”additional strain” of imprisonment, and identifiable groups of
    prisoners are especially susceptible to it. There are discontinuities
    between the literature on adjustment to imprisonment and the literature on
    suicide in prison. Bringing together the separate literatures on coping, on
    suicide, and on the prison experience strenghtens our appreciation of the
    distress suffered in prison and some of the reasons for it. The figures show
    relatively high and increasing rates of prison suicides, particularly among
    sentenced, and notably, life-sentence prisoners. Our profile of the
    suicidial prisoner is incomplete and biased. Different types of prison
    suicide can be identified, and problems of coping with various aspects of
    imprisonment take on special significance for some of these groups.
    Apparently mundane (or routine) features of the prison world can make huge
    demands on limited coping resources.

  abstract: >-
    I argue in this article that people in prison make excellent philosophers,
    for reasons related to what they are deprived of. I also suggest that great
    novels constitute, or at the very least, introduce us to, philosophy. Some
    of the deepest questions about human life can be addressed by fusing
    philosophical thinking with empirical research in prisons. Prisoners talk
    with depth and insight about what it is to feel human, what matters most in
    human experience, and the importance of the ‘vibrations of fellow feeling’.

    The aim of this Policy Framework is to detail the minimum mandatory
    requirements which are needed to deliver the custodial sentence and case
    manage those in custody from reception to end of supervision post release.
    The core requirements of the Offender Management in Custody (OMiC) model and
    the policy for custodial sentence planning have been incorporated into the
    Policy Framework.

    The OMIC model is being implemented in two parallel phases, one is the
    implementation of key work and the other is the new case management model.
    The key work aspects of this Policy Framework apply to all prisons once they
    have started delivering key work in line withtimescales agreed with Prison
    Group Director / Senior Contract Management Team and signed off by the OMIC
    Board. The case management model, which applies to all prisons and probation
    providers, will be implemented by Divisional Implementation Boards and
    signed off by the OMIC Board. The case management aspects of this Policy
    Framework will apply to all prisons and probation providers in line with the
    timescales for implementation agreed with the OMIC Board.

  abstract: >-
    Assessing prisoners’ risk of recidivism and making risk-management
    recommendations is central to the work of prison-based psychologists. Risk
    assessment is particularly crucial when it involves indeterminate sentenced
    prisoners: psychologists’ recommendations have potentially significant
    consequences both for prisoners and the public. However, little is known
    about psychologists’ experiences of conducting such high stakes risk
    assessments. This paper reports the results of an exploration of
    psychologists’ experiences, via interviews and discussions with qualified,
    prison-based psychologists. Analysis using Grounded Theory methods
    identified one super-ordinate category of meaning, namely The Challenging
    Context of Risk Assessment, which comprised two sub-categories: (1) pressure
    of limited resources and (2) pressure of the environment. An additional
    major category, Risk Assessment as a Weighty Task, comprised three
    sub-categories: psychologists described (1) a weight of responsibility
    relating to the magnitude and range of their responsibilities; (2) a weight
    of expectation from colleagues to provide solutions, and (3) the trainee
    dilemma associated with the need to balance development of trainee
    psychologists’ competence in risk assessment with being held accountable for
    their work. Understanding qualified psychologists’ experiences of
    undertaking risk assessments with indeterminate sentenced prisoners can
    facilitate improvements and build on areas of existing good practice.

  abstract: >-
    All prisoners have their identity stripped from them and, ultimately,
    reconstructed by the institutions in which they are incarcerated. However,
    for life and indeterminately sentenced prisoners the effects of this
    process, reinforced over extended periods, creates a particular set of
    burdens. For it is this population, above and beyond that of other
    prisoners, who need to address the implications of an imposed carceral
    identity in both navigating the day-to-day life of the prison and securing
    release. The four core burdens are firstly, an ambiguity on what identity
    indeterminately sentenced prisoners were supposed to have. Secondly,
    reconciling an imposed identity that they did not necessarily feel adhered
    to their pre-established sense of self. Thirdly, recognition that in order
    to operate or perform within the prison they needed to adopt an
    institutionally acceptable form of their self. Fourthly, that they had to
    manage how their performance of self was judged and recorded by the prison.
    This article aims to contribute to the growing body of work on Narrative
    Criminology by arguing that these burdens results in what I define as
    narrative labour.

  abstract: >-
    A new volume of philosophical essays by Bernard Williams. The book is a
    successor to Problems of the Self, but whereas that volume dealt mainly with
    questions of personal identity, Moral Luck centres on questions of moral
    philosophy and the theory of rational action. That whole area has of course
    been strikingly reinvigorated over the last deacde, and philosophers have
    both broadened and deepened their concerns in a way that now makes much
    earlier moral and political philosophy look sterile and trivial. Moral Luck
    contains a number of essays that have contributed influentially to this
    development. Among the recurring themes are the moral and philosophical
    limitations of utilitarianism, the notion of integrity, relativism, and
    problems of moral conflict and rational choice. The work presented here is
    marked by a high degree of imagination and acuity, and also conveys a strong
    sense of psychological reality. The volume will be a stimulating source of
    ideas and arguments for all philosophers and a wide range of other readers.
