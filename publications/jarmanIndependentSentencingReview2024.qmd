# Executive summary {.unnumbered}

This response draws on extensive empirical research with life-sentenced prisoners in England and Wales, alongside comparative international research which focused partly on progression and sentence incentives. It addresses themes 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the review’s call for evidence, focusing particularly on the sentencing and progression of those serving longer sentences for serious offences.

The response demonstrates that:

1. The current prison capacity crisis cannot be resolved without addressing both ‘front door’ sentencing and ‘back door’ progression arrangements [@padfieldFrontDoorBackdoor2014], particularly for those serving longer sentences
2. Public opinion on sentencing is more nuanced and less consistently punitive than often assumed, supporting the case for reform of progression arrangements
3. Current risk-based decision-making about prisoner progression may be systematically over-cautious, potentially keeping many prisoners in custody unnecessarily
4. International evidence suggests that meaningful incentives for progression can be effective, but require careful design and implementation

Based on this analysis, I recommend:

1. Structured progression reform
	 - Earlier access to open conditions for prisoners demonstrating meaningful engagement
	 - Clearer staged incentives linked to sentence progression
	 - Reformed risk assessment focusing on positive evidence of change
	 
2. Enhanced pre-sentence assessment
	 - More detailed individual assessment before sentencing
	 - Clearer linkage between assessment and subsequent progression pathways
	 - Better resourcing for pre-sentence reports

3. Improved victim engagement
	 - Better communication about sentence progression
	 - Enhanced opportunities for victim-prisoner dialogue where appropriate
	 - Clear explanation of risk assessment decisions to victims

4. System-level reforms
	 - Citizens’ assembly on sentencing of serious offences
	 - Implementation of relevant recommendations from the 2022 independent commission on sentencing chaired by Bishop James Jones [@icevlpMakingSenseSentencing2022]
	 - Reformed data collection on progression outcomes

These recommendations aim to balance public protection with other sentencing goals while offering concrete, implementable reforms to support both justice and improved outcomes for offenders, victims, and communities.

# Introduction

## Response author: Ben Jarman

I joined the University of Southampton’s Law School as a [Research Fellow](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/667tyx/doctor-ben-jarman) in December 2024. I hold [a PhD](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/cb763c01-a5c9-49f2-87c9-81ef5ef8f8ee) in Criminology from the University of Cambridge, which used ethnographic interviews and documents to explore the lives in prison of men serving life sentences for murder. Interviews covered life before and since the conviction, and were particularly interested in how participants evaluated themselves in light of a murder conviction, the sanction, and the expectation that to be released from prison, they ought to reduce their risk.

During the PhD I collaborated with the Prison Reform Trust’s [Building Futures project](https://prisonreformtrust.org.uk/project/building-futures/), co-authoring [a report](https://prisonreformtrust.org.uk/publication/making-progress/) on sentence progression for people serving long sentences. I also worked as a specialist adviser to an [independent commission on long sentences](https://prisonreformtrust.org.uk/publication/making-sense-of-sentencing-doing-justice-to-both-victim-and-prisoner/), chaired by Bishop James Jones.

Peer-reviewed journal articles on the PhD and its pilot study have already appeared in several places including the *[British Journal of Criminology](https://doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azaa036* and the *[Prison Service Journal](https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/sites/crimeandjustice.org.uk/files/PSJ%20261%2C%20Mature%20adulthood.pdf)*. I also gave the [keynote address](https://benjarman.uk/publications/jarmanGettingWhatWe2024.html) at the annual meeting of British Quakers in July 2024, which reflected on the research alongside the more personal experience of bereavement, which followed the murder of a friend at an event we both attended at Fishmongers Hall in 2019.

Before joining Southampton, I worked as a Senior Research Fellow at Birkbeck, University of London’s Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research (ICPR), conducting international [comparative research](https://www.icpr.org.uk/unlocking-potential) on prison labour and employment training for prisoners and prison-leavers. It focused in particular on how work in prison is used as an incentive and as a metric of which can be considered ‘reformed’, in prisons in the UK, Brazil, and the United States.

Before working in academia, I was a secondary schoolteacher for seven years, before working in a range of voluntary sector organisations active in the prison reform field, including [Clinks](https://www.clinks.org/) and [Fine Cell Work](https://finecellwork.co.uk/). Through these roles I have worked closely with many people who were serving, or had served, long prison sentences for serious offences.

I make this response as an individual with academic expertise on long-term imprisonment and a professional and personal interest in sentencing.

## Themes covered in this response

This response addresses themes 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the review’s call for evidence. Its primary focus is on long and indeterminate sentences for serious offences involving violence, drawing on extensive empirical research with life-sentenced prisoners in England and Wales. This core subject matter is complemented by international comparative research on sentence progression and incentive structures in prisons in the UK, USA, and Brazil.

The response combines:

- Detailed examination of sentence progression arrangements
- Critical analysis of public opinion research on sentencing
- International comparative perspectives on progression incentives
- Reflection on the relationship between prisoner and victim perspectives

While the focus remains primarily on serious offences and longer sentences, the analysis has broader implications for how progression might be structured and incentivised across the sentenced population.

# Theme 1: History and trends in sentencing

## Overview

This section examines how sentence inflation has contributed to the current prison capacity crisis, tracing three distinct phases of prison population growth since the mid-1990s and highlighting the combined effects of longer sentences, increased use of recall, and growth in the remand population. It shows that these pressures particularly affect prisoners serving longer sentences for serious offences, who often struggle to progress through their sentences effectively. Based on this, I go on to recommend that while the Review should consider measures affecting shorter-sentenced prisoners, it must not exclude longer-sentenced prisoners from its scope, as both ‘front door’ sentencing and ‘back door’ progression and release [@padfieldFrontDoorBackdoor2014] are crucial to any sustainable solution.

## Long-term drivers of population growth

The Review’s call for evidence rightly links the current prison capacity crisis with its long-term cause, sentence inflation. This is welcome. This section of the response describes how the current situation has developed. As the Ministry of Justice’s own analysis [@ministryofjusticeStoryPrisonPopulation2020] (pp. 4–12. makes clear, the major long-term drivers of prison population growth have been:

1. A sentenced prison population which has increasingly been composed of people serving sentences for offences involving physical and sexual violence;
2. An across-the board increase in the average length of sentences imposed for all offences; but with particular reference to the group of serious offenders mentioned in the previous point,
3. An increasing number of sentences involving both an uncertain release date and a period of risk-assessed and conditional release, from which the prisoner may be recalled to custody.

## Three phases of growth since the 1990s

An analysis by the Institute for Government [@rowlandCrisisPrisons2024] adds useful nuance to this picture, by dividing the narrative into three distinct periods.

1. Between the mid-1990s and around 2010, the growth of the sentenced population was driven mainly by increases in the numbers of cases being handled by the courts, though average sentence lengths grew slightly at the same time. Prison capacity expanded during this period, barely keeping pace.
2. From around 2010 until around 2019, the flow of cases ebbed, but increased average sentence lengths and (eventually) a steady increase in recall numbers combined to keep the prison population stable, despite fewer convictions. Capacity overall remained steady, with some new-for-old replacement of closed prisons. For most of the 2010s, the population stayed broadly stable, too, albeit with a growing recall component.
3. From around 2019, rapid increases in the number of recalls, and in the remand population, exacerbated matters, with the resulting pressure abating somewhat during the Covid-19 pandemic, which closed the courts and halted convictions.

This analysis reveals how the current crisis emerges from the interaction of multiple systemic pressures, rather than from any single policy decision or trend. The combination of longer sentences, increased use of recall, and growth in the remand population have created particular challenges for the progression of longer-sentenced prisoners through the system. These pressures are especially acute for those serving sentences for serious offences, who often face unclear or inconsistent progression pathways. Understanding this context is crucial for developing reform proposals that address both immediate capacity pressures and longer-term structural challenges.

## Current pressures on progression and release

Increases in the recall and remand populations are, partly, a function of pressures on the probation and courts services. These pressures have been a significant factor in the growth of the remand and recall populations, remain unresolved, and must be factored into any action aiming to reduce pressure on prison capacity.

There is evidence [e.g. @jarmanMakingProgressWhat2022; @edgarNoLifeNo2020] that some prisoners serving long and indeterminate sentences feel unclear about how they are to progress through the system. Many engage unevenly, intermittently, or not at all with the expectation to address their offending behaviour and reduce their risk. Some serving longer and indeterminate sentences say that they feel as if the prison ‘leaves them to it’, making few explicit demands in relation to the sentence plan until they are some way into the sentence, and thereby, in effect, ‘warehousing’ them for at least some of the sentence.

This issue of sentence progression is addressed more fully under theme 6; the salient point here is that if long-term prisoners do not feel able to address their risk and progress, then this will add to population pressures, since their sentences delay their release if they are unwilling or unable to ‘earn’ their release and reintegration.

## Policy implications

The evidence presented above suggests three key considerations for policy reform.

First, any sustainable solution to current capacity pressures must address both the ‘front door’ of sentencing and the ‘back door’ [@padfieldFrontDoorBackdoor2014] of progression and release mechanisms. Focusing solely on reducing new receptions, without addressing progression pathways for those already in the system, is unlikely to yield sustainable reductions in the prison population.

Second, progression arrangements for longer-sentenced prisoners require particular attention. This group has become an increasingly significant proportion of the prison population, yet progression pathways for them often remain unclear or inconsistent. Reform of these pathways could yield benefits both for prison capacity and for sentence effectiveness.

Third, the relationship between sentence length and progression needs systematic review. Longer sentences do not automatically translate into more effective rehabilitation or public protection, particularly when progression pathways are unclear or poorly structured. Potentially, reform of progression arrangements would improve both system efficiency and sentence effectiveness.

These considerations support the case for structured progression reform, particularly for those serving longer sentences. Such reform should aim to create clearer, more consistent progression pathways while maintaining appropriate public protection measures. This approach would address both immediate capacity pressures and longer-term systemic challenges identified in the historical analysis.

## Implications for the review: considering both ‘front’ and ‘back’ door sentencing

The policy implications outlined above indicate that the Review must consider both ‘front’ and ‘back’ door sentencing [@padfieldFrontDoorBackdoor2014] in developing its recommendations. This dual focus is particularly important given the evidence that both sentence allocation and sentence administration can contribute to prison population pressure. Neither short-term measures affecting sentence allocation, nor administrative changes to progression arrangements alone, will be sufficient to address the systemic pressures identified in the historical analysis.

Neither 2024’s emergency early release measures (which brought forward the automatic release point for some serving determinate sentences), nor a reduction in the courts backlog (which will lower the remand numbers but increase the sentenced population), will address these long-term factors.

It follows that a review seeking long-term solutions should make recommendations in relation to both the allocation of sentences at the ‘front’ door, and the administrative progression and release measures which comprising the ‘back’ door. Moreover, because the sentencing of serious cases has been the consistent long-term driver of prison population growth, my recommendation would be that the Review should not exclude this group from its consideration. It should certainly make recommendations in relation to ‘less dangerous’ offenders serving shorter, and often determinate, sentences, but should also examine the sentencing of more serious offenders.

Having established that both ‘front’ and ‘back’ door sentencing require attention, including for serious offences, we must consider how public opinion shapes the political feasibility of reform in this area.

# Theme 2: Structures

## Overview

This section examines how public opinion influences sentencing policy, summarising evidence that challenges some common assumptions about public attitudes to punishment. Drawing on recent polling and academic research, it shows that public views on sentencing are often poorly informed, unstable over time, and less punitive than commonly assumed, particularly when respondents are given more information about specific cases. It explores how public campaigns can create pressure for increased severity in sentencing, and considers how sentencing institutions might better respond to public opinion without allowing it to determine policy entirely. Based on this, the section recommends revisiting earlier proposals made by a previous independent commission on sentencing [@icevlpMakingSenseSentencing2022], suggesting that these proposals offer a constructive and detailed path forwards which would be particularly useful in considering the politically awkward matter of how to tackle the punishment of serious offenders, who (as a group) are seldom a popular cause.

## How public opinion on sentencing is understood in policy

The Review’s call for evidence invites reflection on the structures and processes that contribute to sentencing, naming institutions including the government, parliament, the Sentencing Council, the judiciary and the courts, and the Attorney General. It was striking to me that the call for evidence made relatively few references to ‘the public’, in whose name alone punishments imposed by a democratic state may claim legitimacy. Nearly all of these references to ‘the public’ relate to ‘public protection’. This is unsurprising, since it is a specific sentencing aim. There is one reference to public confidence in sentences, when the call’s introduction of theme 3 invites respondents to reflect on how technology may be used to make community sentences more ‘robust’. Under this theme, number 2 (‘structures’), however, there is just one reference to the public—obliquely—when the call invites respondents to “consider [.…] how external campaigns influence policy”.

The call does not state this explicitly, but these references imply that “the public” may generally be assumed to favour sentences which protect them against crime, and which are appropriately ‘tough’ and punitive. Public opinion on sentencing is complex, and difficult to gauge confidently. Even so, the first assumption holds up more firmly against the available evidence.

## Public understanding of sentencing

A key factor in public opinion research is how well informed respondents are. Polling indicates that public understanding of sentencing and of the criminal justice system is limited, and does not recognise the recent direction of travel. For example:

1. Most members of the public overestimate crime rates, including rates of serious violent offending, and believe (incorrectly) that they have risen over the long term @robertsPublicKnowledgeSentencing2022;
2. An overwhelming majority underestimate the severity of sentences handed down, including for serious offences @robertsPublicKnowledgeSentencing2022;
3. A majority believe (incorrectly) that sentences, on average, have grown shorter @robertsPublicKnowledgeSentencing2022;
4. A majority believe (incorrectly) that prisoners released after longer sentences are more likely to reoffend @robertsWhosPrisonWhats2024;
5. Just under half believe that prison conditions are too ‘easy’ on prisoners, but over three quarters also say that they know ‘not very much’ or ‘nothing at all’ about prisons @robertsWhosPrisonWhats2024.

## How information affects public views

Similarly, the degree to which public opinion is informed tends to affect the penal aims it endorses:

1. Members of the public are more likely to support ‘tougher’ penalties when they consider what punishment is appropriate for a given offence in the abstract [@mitchellPublicOpinionSentencing2010].
2. They are less likely to support ‘tough’ sanctions when they are asked to select a penalty in the same way which sentencers must: with relevant information at hand about the circumstances of the offence [@mitchellPublicOpinionSentencing2010].

Finally, even allowing for these distinctions about how well informed opinion may be, when asked (in the abstract) to consider the purposes of even the most ostensibly punitive sentence (imprisonment), the public may not actually consider that punishment is the most important aim. Specifically:

1. Polling respondents invited to select the most important reason to impose a prison sentence were most likely to select ‘protecting the public by removing offenders from society’ (chosen by 42%).
2. The purpose next most likely to be selected as ‘most important’ was rehabilitation (chosen by 19%), though over half of respondents did not believe that prisons were delivering that aim effectively [8].

## The (in)stability of public opinion

On this basis, two things seem clear about UK public opinion on sentencing:

1. It cannot automatically be assumed to be punitive (in the sense of wanting ‘tough’ penalties to the exclusion of other goals), even when considering the reasons to send someone to prison. Meanwhile,
2. There is considerable diversity of opinion *between* individuals.

To these findings can be added a recently published international study, which (uniquely, as far as I am aware) gauges the stability over time of *the same individuals’* preferences about punishment. Based on a representative sample of over 11,000 individuals polled in six central European countries @uhlInstabilityPunishmentPreferences2024, the research shows how respondents’ views often varied considerably over time, on a range of questions including:

1. How different offences should be ranked in order of seriousness;
2. What *kinds* of penalty are appropriate for these offences;[^1]
3. What quantities (i.e. durations) of punishment are appropriate for these offences.

In other words, a preference for ‘tough’ or ‘lenient’ sentencing is often not stable over time, *even within the same individual*, and sentencing preferences may be responsive to extraneous factors, such as the respondent’s mood. This, the authors of the study suggest, favours an approach to penalty-setting which takes public opinion on punishment as a “valued beginning”, but does not treat it as the only relevant consideration [@uhlInstabilityPunishmentPreferences2024] (p. 14., particularly when it comes to issues of principle with rights implications, such as how to determine the upper limits.

This research does not relate to UK public opinion, which (it has often been argued) is typically more punitive than in comparable European countries. But the findings are consistent across the six countries covered by the polling.[^2] There is no obvious reason to suppose that the UK public would depart from this pattern.

## The role of public campaigns

The review invites respondents to reflect on the role played by ‘external campaigns’ in driving up sentencing severity.

Public opinion may manifest itself most visibly and most pressingly to policymakers in the form of such campaigns, which often demand ‘tougher’ sentencing, either at the ’front’ door (in the form of increased penalties), or at the ‘back’ door (in the form of more restrictive release decision-making, and/or more stringent risk controls).

In the first category, various campaigns since the 2003 Criminal Justice Act have resulted in new mandatory ‘starting points’ for different kinds of murder, mostly through amendments to Schedule 21 of that legislation. The Act had already ensured that murder sentencing would become drastically more severe, more or less doubling the starting points which were applied to some kinds of murder before it became law. Since them, the sentencing of homicide has seen changes including the following:

1. (in 2008. a whole-life order starting point for a murder motivated by the desire to advance a racial cause;
2. (in 2010. a 25-year starting point for murders where the offender brought a knife to the scene;
3. (in 2012. a 30-year starting point for murders aggravated by hatred based on disability or transgender identity;
4. (in 2015. a whole-life order starting point for the murder of a police or prison officer killed in the course of their duties;
5. (in 2022. a mandatory life sentence for any person killing an emergency service worker while in the course of committing another crime, including if a jury finds this to have been manslaughter, not murder.

I have described these changes because homicide sentencing is the area I am most familiar with. The number of offenders affected in most of these cases (except item 2. is very small, and there is a good chance that sentencers in each case might independently have selected a sentence just as severe as those which are now statutory requirements. Even so, I believe campaigns for stiffer penalties have also operated with less serious offences than homicide, and other responses to this call for evidence might highlight examples.

Other campaigns by or on behalf of crime victims have focused not on the initial penalty for the offence, but on prison release. Since the statutory release test for parole sentences is clearly and unambiguously a risk assessment, the retrospective considerations which often frame public debate about these campaigns (for instance, whether the prisoner has been ‘punished enough’, how aggravated was the original offence, and whether release is ‘deserved’) are out of scope; only considerations of risk are relevant.[^3] Yet the campaigns often carry considerable public support, which in turn is often largely indifferent to technical arguments about risk or the purpose of the decision-making process.

In short, campaigns can relate either to the allocation of the sentence, or its administration (including with reference to release). In each case, what is more significant (for current purposes) than the merits or results of any individual campaign is the underlying pattern of change which has by now become well established. It resembles a ratchet: if sentences do become more severe at the front or back door, then it will be politically difficult to wind the clock back.

This is, largely, because of how public opinion presents itself to decision-makers through campaigns. To ignore or deny campaigners’ demands can appear naïve, out of touch, tin-eared, or indifferent to victims’ suffering; while to grant them may commit resources to punishment which could yield greater public benefit elsewhere, or upset the balance between different sentencing aims and undermine the coherence of the sentencing framework as a whole. Meanwhile, efforts to consult or solicit public opinion on sentencing more broadly may be lacking.

This analysis of public opinion and campaigns reveals significant tensions in how democratic legitimacy is operationalised in sentencing policy. The evidence suggests that public views on sentencing are more complex and potentially less punitive than often assumed, particularly when better informed. Yet the institutional mechanisms through which public opinion typically influences policy tend to amplify more punitive voices, creating a subtle bias toward increased severity. This raises questions about how sentencing institutions might better reflect the nuanced reality of public opinion while maintaining democratic accountability.

## Policy implications

The evidence presented above about public opinion and its influence on sentencing policy suggests several key considerations for reform.

First, the analysis indicates that current institutional arrangements for incorporating public views into sentencing policy may be systematically flawed. The tendency for specific campaigns to generate increased severity, combined with evidence that public opinion is actually more nuanced than often assumed, suggests that new mechanisms may be needed to capture and reflect public views more accurately.

Second, the evidence about how information affects public attitudes has significant implications for policy development. The finding that better-informed respondents often favour less punitive approaches suggests that any reform process should incorporate deliberative elements allowing for detailed consideration of evidence. This supports the case for mechanisms such as citizens’ assemblies, which can facilitate more informed public engagement with sentencing policy than is possible for parliament, government, or the Sentencing Council, each of which has a more specific (and ongoing) role.

Third, the instability of individual punishment preferences over time raises important questions about how sentencing policy should respond to public opinion. This finding suggests that policy should not simply track apparent public preferences, but should instead seek to engage public views while maintaining consistent principles and limits, and clear frameworks for decision-making.

These implications point toward specific reforms in how sentencing institutions engage with public opinion:

1. Enhanced mechanisms for informed public deliberation about sentencing policy
2. Better communication about how sentences operate in practice
3. Clearer frameworks for balancing public views with other considerations
4. More systematic collection of evidence about public attitudes to sentencing

## Implications for the review: reflecting public opinion constructively

The policy implications outlined above suggest that sentencing institutions can and should seek more constructive ways to engage with public opinion. The evidence indicates that public views on sentencing are more complex and potentially less punitive than often assumed, particularly when people are given detailed information about specific cases. This suggests scope for reform that better reflects the nuanced reality of public attitudes while maintaining democratic accountability.

Building on these insights, Bishop James Jones’s independent commission on sentencing [@icevlpMakingSenseSentencing2022] made several detailed recommendations on how the sentencing of serious offences might be reformed, and how the ‘ratchet’ referred to above might be disengaged through a process of consultation and involvement by an informed panel of public opinion. I draw the Review’s attention back to these recommendations, which I have paraphrased and summarised in the following list:

1. A public debate on the sentencing framework for serious crimes, to be taken forward in different ways by the Law Commission, the Sentencing Council, and citizens’ assemblies;
2. Better communication with victims throughout the criminal justice process, including
3. Better communication (if the victim wants it) about how the person who victimised them is being held accountable in prison;
4. Better enforcement of existing victim entitlements;
5. Better access to restorative justice for both victims and offenders in serious cases;
6. Some alterations to the ‘content’ of long sentences, meaning what activities prisoners may access;
7. More scrutiny of sentence progression arrangements, to make these an explicit indicator of prison performance;
8. Improvements to the parole process;
9. Measures to remedy the injustices affecting those on IPP sentences.

The Commission’s key recommendation was the first: a national debate on how *the most serious cases* are sentenced. Crucially, it suggested that this debate should involve not only the institutions mentioned in the Review’s call for evidence (e.g. courts, the government, parliament, the Sentencing Council, etc.), but also the public.

The mechanism which the Commission recommended for debate among the wider public was a citizens’ assembly or citizens’ jury. I remain convinced that such an arrangement would better represent public opinion than other forms of representation, including through Parliament. In this section I have tried to show three things:

1. That public opinion is more subtle, and may be less punitive, than is sometimes apparent to policymakers;
2. That policymakers, because they hold formal power over the sentencing process, are more likely to come under pressure to use that power to increase penalties, a position from which it is then difficult for them to reverse;
3. That soliciting public opinion on sentencing policy via a jury-like or citizens’ assembly arrangement might represent a more constructive means than those which have channelled public opinion into sentencing policy over the last thirty or more years, and might (if this was what the public wanted) be more likely to yield a more legitimate (and perhaps less severe) sentencing framework for serious offences.

On this basis, I recommend that this Review should revisit the recommendations of that report, and consider adopting them.

The evidence about public opinion presented above suggests scope for a more nuanced approach to sentencing serious offences than the current bifurcated framework permits.

## Implementation considerations

The implementation of these recommendations would require careful attention to several practical considerations:

First, the design of any citizens’ assembly or similar deliberative mechanism would need careful consideration. Key questions would include:

- How to ensure representative participation
- What information and evidence to present
- How to structure deliberation about complex trade-offs
- How to connect deliberative outcomes with formal policy processes
- How to ensure that the voices of all key stakeholders were represented

Second, reforms to enhance pre-sentence assessment would require:

- Additional resources for report preparation
- Clear guidance on assessment frameworks
- Mechanisms to link assessment outcomes with sentence planning
- Training for staff conducting assessments

Third, improved communication about sentencing would need:

- Clear protocols for information sharing
- Enhanced capacity for victim liaison
- Better data collection about sentence outcomes
- Regular evaluation of communication effectiveness

These implementation challenges are significant but not insurmountable. The evidence presented above suggests that addressing them would yield substantial benefits in terms of both public confidence and system effectiveness.

# Theme 5: Custodial sentences

## Overview

This section examines how the current ‘bifurcated’ approach to sentencing creates particular challenges for those convicted of serious offences, who face an increasingly restrictive system of risk-based decision-making about their release. It analyzes evidence suggesting that the current emphasis on risk assessment may be overly cautious, potentially keeping many prisoners in custody unnecessarily, while creating practical challenges for sentence administration. Drawing on both research evidence and direct experience of working with prisoners and being affected by serious crime, it explores how progression through sentences might be better incentivized while remaining sensitive to victims’ perspectives. Based on this, the section recommends incorporating clearer staged incentives into sentences, particularly through earlier progression to open conditions or release for those who demonstrate meaningful engagement with their sentence.

## The bifurcated approach to sentencing

The sentencing of serious offences is part of a wider approach to sentencing which the academic literature describes as ‘bifurcated’, in that it “distinguishes between the treatment of ‘dangerous’ violent and sexual offenders, and those ‘minor’ criminals, typically found guilty of volume property offences” @guineyMarginalGainsDiminishing2019 (p. 140.. As well as being subject to the ‘ratcheting’ of penalties described above, it typically also subjects the first group to “an increasingly prohibitive system of discretionary decision-making, couched in the language of risk, dangerousness and public protection” [@guineyMarginalGainsDiminishing2019] (p. 141.. Meanwhile for the second group of more ‘minor’ offenders, it uses non-custodial sanctions or determinate prison sentences qualifying for automatic release. The aim is to accelerate this group’s progression through the system, or to divert them from custody altogether.

## Limitations of risk-based decision making

Though this approach to sentencing is now well entrenched, it is not without difficulties. Most fundamentally, violence risk assessment (like any activity involving the prediction of rare events) involves a high risk of error. Both ‘false positives’ (prisoners who are released but will go on to commit serious offences while on licence) and ‘false negatives’ (those who are denied release but would not have committed further serious offences) are difficult to identify, but the academic literature is clear that for reasons connected with the nature of prediction, the second category (‘false negatives’) potentially contains far more individuals. It is likely that far more people are held in prison when this is *not* necessary to protect the public, than are released when it would have been.

## Practical implications for sentence administration

The caution with which the Parole Board approaches its task is understandable, and is supported by what we know of public opinion on sentencing, which is more likely to support the use of prison to protect the public, than to endorse its use for any other aim. Nonetheless, given the uncertainties of risk assessment, the benefit of the doubt is systematically stacked against those ‘false negative’ prisoners who pose no real risk to the public. The risk of procedural injustice should be named and acknowledged, even if it is considered to be an acceptable trade-off.

More practically, the current approach keeps many people in prison who do not in fact pose a real risk to the public. This outcome is a systematic consequence of the bifurcated approach to ‘dangerous’ offenders, and puts considerable strain on the Parole Board, the prison service, and more generally any agency responsible for the administration of the sentence and the protection of the public. It adds to demand for accredited rehabilitative and risk-reducing interventions (since the structure of parole release sentences implies that rehabilitation must be credentialled and ‘evidence-based’), which in turn results in the rationing and demand management of these interventions. This situation has become the context for many of the difficulties with sentence progression described in the following section.

## Problems with current assumptions

It bears emphasis that many assumptions underpinning the bifurcated approach to more serious cases are questionable [@kemshallDangerousOffendersRelease2013]. In particular, making risk and its reduction the prisoner’s responsibility, and making release conditional on the demonstration of reduced/manageable risk, ignores the fact that much risk is dynamic and contextual, and contingent on factors which do not all lie within the prisoner’s control. It also assumes (wrongly) that risk assessments and the prisoner classifications based on them can be assumed to be reliable and based on accurate, complete information. And it assumes that the thresholds between risk levels (i.e. ‘high’, ‘medium’, and ‘low’) are distinct and clearly identifiable, rather than arbitrary and blurred.

These systematic limitations of risk-based decision-making raise fundamental questions about how institutions might better balance public protection with other statutory sentencing aims. The evidence suggests that current arrangements systematically privilege certain forms of knowledge about risk over others, potentially obscuring important evidence of change and development during sentences. This privileging of particular forms of knowledge about risk has significant implications both for how sentences are experienced by prisoners and victims, and for how progression pathways might be structured more effectively.

## Balancing public protection with other aims

Public protection is, rightly, understood as an overriding aim in sentencing. However, as the report by Bishop James Jones’s sentencing commission [@icevlpMakingSenseSentencing2022] found, it can also can distort the scope for the other aims of the sentence to be realised, as can the sheer length of penalty imposed in the first place. I recommend that report’s chapter on how well long sentences balance the five statutory purposes of sentencing to the Review.[^4]

This section does not minimise the risks to the public associated with releasing the wrong people; it has, however, shown that the current sentencing arrangements for serious offences contain a systematic bias against the release of ‘false negatives’. To underline this: the current setup of risk-assessed releases means that the number of prisoners serving parole release sentences who are kept in prison unnecessarily is unquantifiable, but very likely much larger than the number who are released when they still pose a risk to the public.

Caution with this ‘false negative’ group is justified, but so too is an attempt to correct for the systematic bias against their progression and release. This should take the form of efforts to recognise and incentivise progression by those serving extended and indeterminate sentences who demonstrate a willingness to develop themselves. The most effective incentive, albeit one which is remote for many, is the prospect of earlier progression and release from prison. This could be achieved either by linking personal development goals to the parole eligibility date, or by permitting an increased (and earlier) use of open conditions as an incentive.

## Bridging prisoner and victim perspectives: personal and institutional insights

The implications of reformed progression arrangements for victims require careful consideration. Drawing on both research evidence and personal experience, I want to reflect carefully on how institutions might better recognise and respond to the complex relationship between prisoner and victim perspectives.

My empirical research has brought me into sustained contact with people serving very long sentences, permitting close observation of how they engage, often in good faith, with institutional expectations of reform and rehabilitation. This proximity has revealed how systemic frustrations—particularly those arising from unclear or inconsistent expectations—can generate additional barriers to meaningful engagement. When prisoners feel institutional processes have treated them unfairly, the resulting frustration can itself be interpreted as evidence of risk, creating a difficult situation where legitimate grievances must often be suppressed rather than expressed.

Yet my perspective on these institutional dynamics has been profoundly shaped by personal experience of serious violence, specifically the murder of a friend in circumstances which felt like a profound betrayal of trust. This experience left me with powerful emotions to process, but prior research experience means I have been unable simply to discount everything I have observed about the institutional challenges faced by prisoners—who often experience genuine remorse but struggle to gain recognition for personal change within their sentences as currently administered.

This combination of perspectives—as researcher and as someone affected by serious crime—has led me to reflect on how sentences might better bridge the apparent gulf between prisoner and victim interests. I suggest that this gulf is not inevitable, but is often reinforced by institutions which position prisoner and victim interests as inherently opposed. Reformed progression arrangements could help address this by:

1. Creating clearer frameworks for recognising and evidencing personal change
2. Developing more sophisticated approaches to risk assessment
3. Establishing better opportunities for victim-prisoner dialogue where appropriate
4. Ensuring progression frameworks maintain appropriate accountability while avoiding purely adversarial dynamics

These insights align with and extend my evidence about how sentence progression might better serve both institutional and individual needs. The Independent Commission’s report on long sentences [@icevlpMakingSenseSentencing2022] (pp. 55-58. makes particularly relevant observations about institutional barriers to making amends, and about how structured opportunities for victim-prisoner dialogue might help bridge perspective gaps. These findings informed the Commission’s recommendation 5, which has direct relevance for how progression might be reformed.

## Policy implications

The analysis presented above suggests several key considerations for policy reform.

First, the evidence about systematic bias in risk assessment indicates a need to consider other factors than risk alone into decision-making around progression. Current arrangements appear to generate an excess of ‘false negatives’—prisoners denied progression despite posing manageable or minimal risks to others. There is scope for a more nuanced approach which balances public protection with recognition of personal change.

Second, the relationship between institutional frustration and risk assessment requires attention. Current arrangements may inadvertently create barriers to progression by interpreting legitimate grievances about unclear progression pathways as evidence of continuing risk. This indicates a need for:

- Clearer frameworks for progression decision-making
- Mechanisms to address prisoner grievances about ‘blocked’ progression
- More sophisticated interpretations of institutional behaviour

Third, the evidence about prisoner-victim perspectives suggests potential for approaches which better serve both groups’ interests, without assuming that they must be antagonistic. This might include:

- Enhanced opportunities for dialogue
- Better communication about progression decisions
- Clearer links between personal development and progression
- More sophisticated approaches to evidencing reform

These implications suggest specific areas for reform:

1. Risk assessment frameworks

- Development of more nuanced assessment tools
- Better integration of evidence about personal change
- Enhanced mechanisms for challenging decisions
- Regular review of assessment outcomes

1. Progression pathways

- Clearer staging of progression steps, perhaps indicating a normative sequence starting with offence-related work within an expected timescale, and permitting earlier progression to be earned subsequently
- Better integration with sentence planning
- Enhanced incentives for meaningful engagement
- Improved mechanisms for evidencing development

1. Institutional processes

- Reformed grievance procedures
- Enhanced communication mechanisms
- Better staff training and support
- Regular evaluation of outcomes

These reforms would require careful implementation but could yield benefits for institutional legitimacy, public protection, and sentence effectiveness.

## Implementation considerations

The implementation of these reforms would require attention to several practical challenges:

First, reforms to risk assessment would need:

- Development of new assessment frameworks
- Staff training and development
- Enhanced quality assurance processes
- Regular evaluation of outcomes

Second, changes to progression pathways would require:

- Clear implementation guidance
- Additional resources for sentence planning
- Enhanced monitoring arrangements
- Regular review of effectiveness

Third, institutional process reforms would need:

- Careful change management
- Enhanced staff support
- Clear communication strategies
- Regular feedback mechanisms

While significant, these implementation challenges should be weighed against the potential benefits:

- More effective use of prison places
- Enhanced institutional legitimacy
- Better outcomes for victims and prisoners
- Improved public protection through more accurate risk assessment

Successful implementation would require sustained commitment but could yield substantial improvements in both system effectiveness and individual outcomes, as well as potentially reducing prison population pressures.

# Theme 6: Progression of custodial sentences

## Overview

This section examines how sentence progression might be better incentivized, drawing on research with prisoners serving different sentence lengths in the UK and internationally, particularly focusing on ‘credits’ schemes in the US and Brazil. It analyzes how different approaches to incentivizing progression can affect prisoner behavior and institutional legitimacy, while highlighting administrative challenges in implementing such schemes effectively. Drawing on both international comparisons and UK-specific research, it explores how progression incentives might be structured to promote genuine reform while remaining practically manageable. Based on this, the section identifies key considerations that should guide the design of any new progression-based incentive scheme in the UK context.

## Background and scope

In this section, I draw on PhD research, as well as the prisoner consultation on progression during long sentences which I carried out in 2021/22 [@jarmanMakingProgressWhat2022]. In those two projects I covered only respondents serving custodial sentences of more than ten years. However, while working at Birkbeck, I also interviewed prisoners in three English prisons serving a full range of sentences of different kinds. I also interviewed several ex-prisoners from three US states[^5] which use ‘credits’ schemes of the kind mentioned by the Review’s call for evidence; and I learned something about how Brazilian prisons use incentives and sentence credits.

A major theme in these Birkbeck interviews was prisoners’ motivations for engaging in the regime (including through work), and what they thought about the incentives and rewards offered for this engagement. I understand that my former Birkbeck colleagues will respond separately to this call for evidence. This section therefore limits itself to comments based on the long-term population, but with some more specific reflection on sentence credit schemes in the US. I have already indicated, in previous sections, that I believe long-term prisoners should be able to work towards a reduction in the amount of time they will spend in prison, and so in this section, I will not make substantive recommendations, but instead comment on some considerations which the use of such incentives in prison need to bear in mind.

## Understanding compliance and motivation

All incentives, including credits schemes, are affected by the problem that compliant behaviour alone is difficult to interpret, and that the presence of strong incentives exacerbates this problem. People may comply because they want to obtain a reward; or they may fear a penalty or the withdrawal of an incentive previously offered if they do not comply; or they may comply because they are fatalistic and resigned and have no conscious reason for acting as they do; or they comply because they understand the reasons they are being asked to comply, and consider them right and appropriate. The grounds for complying may change over time, and all of this means that incentives schemes need to be structured and designed with care, with attention to the kinds of behaviour they seek to generate (and why), and the kinds of (il)legitimacy they may generate in practice.

A nuanced understanding of compliance has implications for how progression incentives might be structured institutionally. The evidence suggests that institutional legitimacy—and hence the likelihood of normative rather than merely instrumental compliance—depends significantly on how clearly progression pathways are articulated and how fairly they are administered. This raises the question of how sentence progression might better align institutional priorities with prisoners’ own motivations for change, while maintaining appropriate accountability for serious offending.

## US approaches to sentence credits

US sentence credits schemes covered in my Birkbeck research generally permitted prisoners serving determinate sentences to earn remission of the sentence, in the form of different kinds of ‘credits’. Interviews with prisoners and examination of the rulebooks governing these schemes reveal that they are often administratively extremely complicated. Credits were available for a range of more and less well-defined behaviours including satisfactory work performance, programme participation, and ‘good behaviour’.

Although the associated rulebooks and policies governing these schemes were voluminous and detailed, my interviews with former US prisoners from three states suggested that in practice, credits were offered (and withdrawn, and reinstated) largely at the discretion of staff. Complaints and appeals against (for example) the unjust or irregular use of the credits scheme were possible, but prisoners who made them incurred risks. My interviewees (who were not necessarily representative) generally seemed to consider that the incentives schemes were not worth trying to understand, since there was no realistic prospect of their being administered in line with the rules. It is also worth noting that all three states we examined made some categories of prisoner ineligible for credits: in California, for instance, lifers (who make up around one-third of the state prison population there) are excluded, and in Arizona and Texas those serving sentences for some violent and sexual offences may not earn credits.

## The Brazilian model

A slightly different approach to credits is taken by prisons in Brazil, where all sentences are determinate, where risk assessment plays very little role in release, and where there is little post-release supervision other than through electronic tagging. Brazilian prisons are also extremely overcrowded, and remission of the sentence is one of the main strategies used to manage overcrowding. Brazilian law offers remission in a structured way: prisoners who are able to access prison work (which is not available to all) have their sentences reduced by one day for each three days of work completed; they may also earn remission at a similar rate for certain other activities. These include reading books (in which case they have to prepare a written report on the book).

My understanding is that remission earned in this way has the status of a right, not a privilege (i.e. it cannot be withdrawn). But it also creates significant administrative complexity, including for staff who have to record activities, and for the penal execution judges who oversee sentences there. Not all prisoners are able to access work (hence there is uneven access to remission), and some Brazilian states have major administrative backlogs in logging and recording prisoner activities, to the extent that some are held in prison after the point where their remission (if correctly administered) should have seen them released.

## Synthesising international evidence: key insights for UK reform

The evidence presented above offers insights to the review’s consideration of sentencing in England and Wales. First, it demonstrates how different institutional arrangements for managing progression create distinct patterns of compliance and resistance. The US evidence suggests that systems which tend to operate on a discretionary basis (even if they are governed in theory by policies), offer operational flexibility but may undermine institutional legitimacy through perceived arbitrariness. Meanwhile, the Brazilian system’s more structured approach to sentence remission demonstrates both the appeal and the administrative challenges of rights-based progression frameworks.

Second, the evidence reveals important tensions between systemic efficiency and individual justice. In both countries, attempts to accelerate progression for some groups while restricting it for others can generate unintended consequences, potentially undermining operational effectiveness and rehabilitative aims. Careful attention is needed to how any reformed progression framework might balance objectives relevant to the system and to individuals.

Third, the comparative analysis highlights crucial questions about how sentence progression might better integrate different forms of knowledge about prisoner development. The US experience suggests that excessive staff discretion may privilege certain forms of knowledge about compliance while obscuring others. Meanwhile, the Brazilian approach indicates how more structured frameworks might better recognise diverse forms of personal development, albeit with significant administrative implications.

These insights suggest that any reform of how the sentence itself may be adjusted to incentivise rehabilitative goals should include:

- Careful attention to questions of legitimacy
- Clear frameworks for recognising and rewarding engagement
- Sophisticated approaches to evidencing personal development
- Robust administrative systems for recording progression
- Regular evaluation of implementation effectiveness

## Lessons from international comparisons

### Key principles from UK experience

Before reflecting on how these examples might inform reformed UK sentence progression, it is worth underlining three general points, which are absolutely clear to me from my research and professional experience:

1. Earlier access to open conditions, and earlier release, are by far the most appealing (and therefore effective) incentives prisons can offer;
2. Better material conditions can also be effective, but to nothing like the same extent; and
3. Neither of these on its own can be assumed to reduce the risk of reoffending (although each may play its part).

### Implications of the US approach

Reflecting specifically on the international examples, it is evident, first, that the US approach to credits resembles the UK’s current bifurcated approach to sentencing, in that it seeks to accelerate the progression through the system of ‘ordinary’ prisoners, while delaying or preventing the progression of those whose offending was more serious, and/or who have been classified as ‘dangerous’. This conclusion is consistent with academic research noting a bifurcated approach to sentencing in many US states [@seedsBifurcationNationAmerican2017].

In this context, it may be worth reflecting on how the state prison populations of California and Texas have changed since US imprisonment rates as a whole peaked in the late 2000s. Although both states’ prisons have emptied out to an extent, both have also seen a reallocation of less serious offenders from state prisons to local jails, where the use of short sentences leads to ‘revolving door’ outcomes and high rates of reoffending. Meanwhile, the number of prisoners serving long and indeterminate sentences in state prisons has remained high, with this group becoming a growing proportion of an increasingly elderly and institutionalised whole.

The UK lacks a direct equivalent to the US’s stateand local-level criminal justice systems, meaning that a similar use of remissions/credits here would play out differently. But it is worth noting that by excluding ‘dangerous’ and long/indeterminately sentenced prisoners from the opportunity to earn earlier release, some states’ drives to decarcerate have seen limited success, in that they have redistributed, rather than reducing, overall prisoner numbers [@jarmanWorkingPrisonersUSA2024] (pp. 4–6, 16–21..

A second, simpler point relating to the US is simply that the use of remission credits there appears to be associated with an increased grant of discretionary power to prison staff. This, potentially, favours prison order, but is also open to irregularity and potential abuse, with all the damage this can do to legitimacy. Perhaps of greater consequence is the question of how far US prisons actually apply credits in line with a detailed and well-worked-through understanding of what will reduce the risk of reoffending. In other words, do the incentives promote short-term prison order, long-term prisoner reform, or something else? I cannot answer this question, but its centrality to the design of any incentive scheme which aims to incentivise reform should be clear.

### Administrative challenges and considerations

In relation to Brazil, two main lessons may be relevant to the Review’s consideration of incentives to promote progression and reform, and how they might generate just and improved outcomes for offenders, victims, and communities. First, for the UK to imitate Brazil’s use of sentence remission (rather than the US’s) would depart far more substantially from the current bifurcated framework which guides sentencing here at present. In Brazil, remission, once earned, cannot easily be withdrawn; this is inconsistent with the conditional and discretionary use of incentives and privileges offered through (for example) the IEP scheme over the last thirty years or more. It is also less obviously compatible with the highly conditional and supervised parole releases which characterise so many sentences currently. Against these reservations may be set the fact that the Brazilian use of incentives very definitely offers a concrete and highly meaningful message that to play by the rules will generate a reward, something which many prisoners in the UK currently perceive to be lacking.

The second lesson from Brazil is an administrative one: the more formalised (and less discretionary) an incentive scheme becomes, the more complex it becomes to administer, entailing a burden in terms of data recording and entry, and with the data recorded (eventually) potentially requiring interpretation, as for example when parole boards are required to weigh evidence of participation in programmes when making risk assessments. In my PhD research, while reviewing selected prison documents on some of the life-sentenced men whom I had interviewed, I noted that there were far more records of negative IEP entries than of positive ones. Moreover, while the negative entries usually of clear relevance to risk assessment (because, for instance, they recorded a negative drug test, or involvement in a fight), the positive entries were much more likely to record forms of behaviour which were of less obvious relevance to risk: courtesies to staff, or cooperation during a tricky situation on the wing, for example, or other situations in which prisoners had compliantly reproduced prison order. Such information, despite the intention to record positive conduct, was of questionable relevance in risk assessment, and hence of questionable use to the risk assessments which, in this case, actually determined progression. This, again, underlines the importance of staff being guided on the kinds of conduct and behaviour which are desirable and relevant to the kind of reform which is being promoted.

## Policy implications

The evidence presented above suggests several key considerations for policy reform.

First, progression frameworks must carefully balance structure with flexibility. Some discretion in progression decision-making is necessary, but this must be exercised within clear frameworks that maintain legitimacy. This suggests:

- Clear criteria for progression decisions
- Transparent processes to challenge and review decisions
- Regular review of decision-making patterns
- Enhanced mechanisms for evidencing development

Second, administrative arrangements require careful consideration. The international evidence demonstrates how implementation challenges can undermine even soundly conceived frameworks for progression. This indicates a need for:

- Robust systems for recording activities
- Clear guidelines for (and limits on) staff discretion
- Regular monitoring of outcomes
- Adequate resources for implementation

Third, the relationship between progression frameworks and prison order requires attention. Legitimacy can enhance stability, while perceived unfairness might generate resistance, distress, or desperation. This suggests value in:

- Clear communication about progression pathways
- Opportunities for grievance resolution
- Better integration of progression with sentence planning
- Regular evaluation of institutional impacts

These implications suggest specific areas for reform:

1. Progression frameworks

- Development of clearer progression criteria
- Enhanced mechanisms for evidencing change
- Better integration with sentence planning
- Regular review of effectiveness

1. Administrative systems

- Reformed recording arrangements
- Enhanced staff training
- Clear implementation guidance
- Regular outcome monitoring

1. Institutional processes

- Improved communication mechanisms
- Enhanced grievance procedures
- Better staff support arrangements
- Regular evaluation of impacts

## Implications for the review: key considerations for reform

All of these examples suggest that structured incentive schemes using earlier progression to reward good behaviour are highly likely to appeal to prisoners; I believe it is likely that they would help ease pressure on prison places. But the implications of such a change for sentencing practice overall would be wide-ranging, and should not be underestimated, meaning that careful thought would have to be given to the design of any progression-based incentive scheme. I would recommend careful reflection on several considerations, which might include the following:

1. How would victims and communities be assured that earlier progression and release reflected a prisoner’s progression towards goals *which mattered to them*, rather than simply towards goals suiting systemic priorities?
2. Should parole release sentences be included in a progression-based incentive scheme, and if so, how should offending behaviour interventions and other sentence plan goals focused on reducing risk be integrated with such a scheme?
3. How conditionally will sentence-based incentives be offered? Once earned, in what circumstances could they be removed?
4. How important is the goal of reducing prisoner numbers, and what would be the long-term impact on this goal of excluding some prisoner groups (e.g. those serving some kinds of sentence, those convicted of some kinds of offence) from any incentive scheme?

## Implementation considerations

The implementation of reformed progression arrangements would require attention to several practical challenges:

First, institutional capacity:

- Staff training and development needs
- Administrative systems requirements
- Resource implications for implementation
- Monitoring and evaluation arrangements

Second, transition management:

- Clear implementation timelines
- Effective change management processes
- Staff engagement strategies
- Regular progress review mechanisms

Third, outcome monitoring:

- Development of evaluation frameworks
- Data collection arrangements
- Quality assurance processes
- Regular review cycles

While these implementation challenges are significant, the evidence suggests that effective reform of progression arrangements could yield substantial benefits:

- Enhanced institutional legitimacy
- Improved operational efficiency
- Better rehabilitation outcomes
- More effective public protection

Successful implementation would require sustained commitment but could significantly improve both system effectiveness and individual outcomes.
