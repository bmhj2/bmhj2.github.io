	abstract = {The ‘pains of imprisonment’ have been a longstanding concern within prison sociology. This article revisits the topic, suggesting that modern penal practices have created some new burdens and frustrations that differ from other pains in their causes, nature and effects. It notes that the pains of imprisonment can be divided up conceptually, and to some degree historically, into those deriving from the inherent features of incarceration, those resulting from deliberate abuses and derelictions of duty, and those that are consequences of systemic policies and institutional practices. Having described the latter in detail – focusing on the pains of indeterminacy, the pains of psychological assessment and the pains of self-government, the article explains the relevance of the concept of ‘tightness’, as well as ‘depth’ and ‘weight’, to the contemporary prison experience.},

In the conclusion, we summarise the discussion by focusing on the role of values, of relationships and of evidence in the reform and development of probation.},

	abstract = {Given the increasing number of prisoners serving life sentences in England and Wales, and the increasing average length of these sentences, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to the experiences and effects of such sanctions. This article describes how prisoners serving very long sentences from an early age adapt over time to their circumstances. In particular, it focuses on the transition between the early and subsequent stages of such sentences, specifically, the ways that these prisoners adapt to the sentence, manage time, come to terms with their offense, shift their conception of control, make their sentence constructive, and find wider meaning in and from their predicament. Our argument is that most prisoners demonstrate a shift from a form of agency that is reactive to one that is productive, as they learn to “swim with”, rather than against, the tide of their situation.},

"about particular kinds of research approaches" (Crewe et al 2017:518)
what do they mean? (note on p.518)
 
"Changes in legislation have increased the "starting points" for consideration of the minimum period of custody for a range of homicide offenses" (Crewe et al 2017:519)
"disagreements about the effects of confinement reflect differences in the methodological and conceptual commitments of psychologists and sociologists" (Crewe et al 2017:519)
"literature on long-term imprisonment, which has often been the focus of the effects literature generally, because of an assumption that any effects are likely to deepen over longer periods of time" (Crewe et al 2017:520)
"extended periods of incarceration do not appear to have a debilitating impact on such matters as cognitive functioning or self-esteem" (Crewe et al 2017:520)
"the critique relates both to the variables under assessment and an approach that appears to position the long-term prisoner as a kind of research "specimen"" (Crewe et al 2017:520)
Something similar could be said of the RNR approach to rehabilitation. (note on p.520)
 
"highlighted the profound existential implications of prolonged confinement and the ways in which life sentenced prisoners reflected in an ongoing and agentic way on their predicament and how to endure it" (Crewe et al 2017:520)
"the struggle to find meaning and purpose, and to cushion the self against the assault of institutional life" (Crewe et al 2017:521)
"Toch (2010) speculates that many serious and long-term offenders come to feel themselves to be substantially different from the person they were at the point that they committed their index offense. Some undergo "crucial regenerative change pretty much on their own"" (Crewe et al 2017:521)
"this sense of ambiguity is eventually supplanted, as prisoners "construct new narratives of self"" (Crewe et al 2017:521)
On this account desistance merely brings a new approach rather than the identification of a new phenomenon. (note on p.521)
 
"grudgingly" (Crewe et al 2017:521)
"Zamble (1992, p. 421) reports that, over time, such men deliberately withdraw "from the diffuse social networks that are typical of inmate interactions" maintain their emotional ties with people in the community, become more positive in their attitudes towards the criminal justice system, and become progressively more preoccupied with the future" (Crewe et al 2017:522)
Definitely chase and read this. (note on p.522)
 
"long-term prisoners find ways of coping that make the problems of imprisonment more manageable over time" (Crewe et al 2017:522)
"primary life domain" (Crewe et al 2017:522)
Or in my terms, value-sphere. (note on p.522)
 
"we highlight clear differences between the orientations of prisoners at the early and subsequent stages of very long sentences, emphasizing a shift from a form of agency that was essentially backwards-looking and reactive to one which was future-oriented and productive, albeit within the particular parameters of prolonged confinement" (Crewe et al 2017:522)
This would be a good quote to describe what it is that I am responding to or modifying. (note on p.522)
 
"789 male prisoners and 29 female in the England and Wales prison system who met these criteria" (Crewe et al 2017:523)
Rather fewer of the men than I would have guessed. (note on p.523)
 
"drew heavily on the literature" (Crewe et al 2017:524)
"Interviewees were not asked directly to disclose the details of their index offense, but they were not discouraged from doing so" (Crewe et al 2017:524)
Talk to Ben about how to handle this. (note on p.524)
 
"main interests" (Crewe et al 2017:524)
"all participants were asked to reflect at length both on their feelings during the early days and months of their sentence and on the changes in their adaptive styles and strategies during the subsequent periods of the sentence.7" (Crewe et al 2017:524)
"general rather than universal patterns." (Crewe et al 2017:524)
One thing I can offer is a comment on some who were not adapted (note on p.524)
 
"Many prisoners who were further into their sentences continued to harbor underlying feelings of desperation and resentment about their predicament. However, the common view was was that, following an initial period of turmoil, accepting the situation was essential for psychological survival, and “coping” was unexpectedly achievable." (Crewe et al 2017:525)
how many is many? (note on p.525)
 
"a bleak necessity" (Crewe et al 2017:525)
"191 men and women who met the criteria for our study had been transferred to secure psychiatric hospitals" (Crewe et al 2017:525)
Jesus, that's a lot. A kind of sorting, where the prison system sifts those not tough enough to cope out? (note on p.525)
 
"a number of years had passed before they recognized the full implications of their predicament" (Crewe et al 2017:526)
"that's my home" (Crewe et al 2017:526)
Thomas. (note on p.526)
 
"this becomes your world" (Crewe et al 2017:526)
"required prisoners to downplay the deprivations inherent in their predicament" (Crewe et al 2017:527)
"strained optimism of these rationalizations signaled the need for prisoners to try to develop a positive narrative of their current situation" (Crewe et al 2017:527)
"Certain phrases—"I just take each day as it comes"; "you take it a day at a time"—were strikingly recurrent" (Crewe et al 2017:528)
Yet the more distant past is present for the likes of Owen and Regis, in that they are comparing current reactions with it. What is not present is a sense of future overview, or of a kind of strategic perception. Instead remote periods are present in manageable chunks that relate in important ways to current elements of experience. (note on p.528)
 
"Terms such as "stuck in limbo" and "treading water" were telling" (Crewe et al 2017:528)
This is a good way of unpacking the terms of the quote. (note on p.528)
 
"but suggested a much stronger sense of accepting the flow of the present and actively managing the future" (Crewe et al 2017:528)
Do I want to aim my study at the latter side of this division, or both? (note on p.528)
 
"Reaching the halfway point of the tariff, or having only "single figures" remaining were major psychological milestones" (Crewe et al 2017:529)
"In explaining how they passed their days—for example, through reading and study, computer games and television, and the gym—their accounts were not suffused with the sense that they were marooned in or overwhelmed by the present" (Crewe et al 2017:529)
This could tally nicely with some of the data on for example Max, who talked about reading and prayer. There is something here about the way in which reflective activities open up different temporal horizons. I think that Mattingly is a link here as well. (note on p.529)
 
"practices of faith and spirituality to tame the immediate burdens of the present and manage unwanted thoughts" (Crewe et al 2017:529)
Again, there are reflective practices which tame time, and open up something other than the immediate present. (note on p.529)
 
"mid-stage prisoners were much more likely than early-stage prisoners to describe time as something that could be used constructively" (Crewe et al 2017:529)
So there are two things in play here: one is the acquisition of techniques, and the other is the mere passage of time. (note on p.529)
 
"For prisoners beyond the early sentence phase, then, the present was not experienced as a form of "stasis" or stagnation (see Wahidin, 2006), in part because life was no longer considered "on hold," in the past, or being lived elsewhere" (Crewe et al 2017:530)
This makes me think again about the connections with my analysis and particularly the view of the corrective agents that they were looking ahead, versus the view of the redemptive ones that they were looking back. I wonder how (if at all) this picture would have changed had I interviewed people elsewhere than Gartree, for example those who could see beyond the prison walls? The overall argument here is that the adaptation process consists of taming time and taming the offence. I think my analysis adds the idea that taming the offence is a very different kind of challenge for some people as compared to some others. (note on p.530)
 
"hey had sought to deny the full implications of their crime (by engaging in various forms of offense minimization, or by "burying" it through the use of drugs and alcohol)" (Crewe et al 2017:530)
There is a contrast here with the statement by Regis that he knew on his first night in prison that he had done wrong. It would have been very interesting to hear him talk in those early days. (note on p.530)
 
"taking moral responsibility, while also recognizing the futility of being hobbled by what was now in the past" (Crewe et al 2017:531)
This reference to morals could be a nice link to what I have to say, and could help me establish the foreshadowing of the moral anthropology stuff that I add in my conclusion.Perhaps: 'taking moral responsibility, while also recognising the futility of being hobbled by what was now in the past'. But what did this mean for the future? (note on p.531)
 
"by no longer suppressing their feelings of guilt, while finding means of self-forgiveness" (Crewe et al 2017:531)
This sentence also invites further complication and detail. Is self-forgiveness distributed evenly? Do all have the reflexive capacity to undertake such a process? Do others recognise it when they do? How does the prison seek to shape this kind of subjectivity (think of Sam and being taught to say things in a certain way). (note on p.531)
 
"Does it change your identity? It changes who you are. Definitely" (Crewe et al 2017:531)
Again, this invites further investigation, and asks about patterns. (note on p.531)
 
"or some prisoners, this process—what Irwin (2009) calls a "self-inventory"— was prompted by participation in victim awareness courses or prison-based therapeutic communities, or by direct meetings with relatives of their victim. For others, it derived from the rumination produced by endless hours spent alone in a cell" (Crewe et al 2017:531)
Again, I can comment on how this pattern was structured. (note on p.531)
 
"Many interviewees described engaging in forms of self-management" (Crewe et al 2017:532)
This could be made to speak to Owen or Regis describing self-control, or Andy. (note on p.532)
 
"engaging in the kind of reflection and ethical self-cultivation that Foucault (1986) describes as a form of moral "subjectivation."" (Crewe et al 2017:532)
I'd forgotten this reference but again it could be used to foreshadow and establish the need for an approach favouring prisoners' ethical self-cultivation. (note on p.532)
 
"Prisoners in the early stage" (Crewe et al 2017:533)
"virtually no control" (Crewe et al 2017:533)
"Control my anger, that's about it" (Crewe et al 2017:533)
"early-stage prisoners were preoccupied with the basic terms of their predicament, and interpreted "control" in relation to the structural limits on their freedom(s)" (Crewe et al 2017:533)
This is the kind of insight that can open up from reflection and different perspectives on the self. Official discourse offers very few such perspectives, and in fact fairly much continues to define you as one kind of being.I think Max may have said some interesting things in this regard. (note on p.533)
 
"those who were further into their sentences understood control less in relation to external constraints than the internal freedoms that were possible within the parameters of incarceration" (Crewe et al 2017:534)
This is where the near-monastic perspective comes in: a different view, taken again and again and again, deepened and worked into a practice. (note on p.534)
 
""It is what it is"" (Crewe et al 2017:534)
For me too. It's possible that this is why I have quite an intuitive understanding of this kind of perspective. What is interesting is that I think this is one thing prisoners can teach us in general - about the things that we in fact lack control over, and the things that we cannot change. This is a lesson that many of us would benefit by. Viz: https://aeon.co/ideas/to-be-happier-focus-on-whats-within-your-control (note on p.534)
 
"you ain't never going to change it ever" (Crewe et al 2017:534)
"relinquished the unalterable past, submitted to those aspects of the present that they could not alter, and sought to build a constructive future" (Crewe et al 2017:534)
Yes, though I'm not sure the redemptive agents were exactly relinquishing the past, more making a greater effort to integrate it without entirely being determined by it. (note on p.534)
 
"the relocation of "life"—at least in some senses—from the external community to the prison interior" (Crewe et al 2017:535)
"My plan is do as much education as humanly possibl" (Crewe et al 2017:535)
This reminds me of Mustafa. (note on p.535)
 
"Since they were relatively young when sentenced, they felt a sense of loss not—as is often described (e.g. Crawley \& Sparks, 2006; Jewkes, 2005)—for the life that they had already established, but the life that they had expected to lead, their possible selves and achievements." (Crewe et al 2017:535)
This is also a potential point of connection and contrast with my work. (note on p.535)
 
"reported additional ways of finding meaning in their situation or transforming it into something bearable or productive" (Crewe et al 2017:535)
This section in particular would be helpful in preparing the CCA talk. (note on p.535)
 
"talking about the construction of a new personal identity, rather than a set of social relations" (Crewe et al 2017:535)
This is indeed interesting. I wonder how much it may connect with the idea that social relations in prison are not generally seen as potentially lasting ones, but rather associations. Also, the identity you might have is one that cannot be endorsed by others in terms of fulfilment and recognition of social roles. There is something here about the social relationships which are available and the degree to which they are actually able to reflect something that has a future beyond the sentence. (note on p.535)
 
"The term "contentment," linked explicitly to forms of belief, highlighted an attitude of positive fatalism" (Crewe et al 2017:536)
"a wider sense of meaning and purpose, a form of ideological sustenance and "spiritual rejuvenation"" (Crewe et al 2017:536)
"answers to the kinds of existential questions described in previous sections" (Crewe et al 2017:536)
"parameters of thought and philosophical perspective" (Crewe et al 2017:536)
"faith ideologies offered a hook for moral transformation and identity change" (Crewe et al 2017:536)
"Archer argues that, through forms of "internal conversation" or interior dialog, most people pursue practices and projects that are consistent with their "ultimate concerns." The exceptions to this are what Archer calls "fractured reflexives," people who exist in a state of disorientation about these priorities and how to realize them. Such individuals either hold almost no internal dialog at all, or engage in forms of self-talk which provide them "with no instrumental guidance about what to do in practice"" (Crewe et al 2017:537)
It would be interesting to read Archer alongside Mattingly. Ben has commented before that Archer's findings reflect her having done research with university students, who may be capable of greater reflection. I'm not sure about the latter, but I think they do - compared to most lifers I've met - have a greater awareness of the parameters of what social structures might make available to them after their release, and hence perhaps a greater capacity for effective agentic reflection, that is, on what might actually be open to them rather than what they might hope could be open to them. (note on p.537)
 
"While some reflect nostalgically on a past that no longer provides a guide to action—either because of discontinuity of social circumstances, or because of some kind of profound personal change, such as serious illness or marital breakdown—others "grasp in desperation at unrealistic projects"" (Crewe et al 2017:537)
Different kinds of fractured reflection - this relates to the comment I have above. (note on p.537)
 
"sheer difficulty of confronting both their offense and their penal predicament inhibited them from engaging in forms of internal deliberation and future-oriented life-building" (Crewe et al 2017:537)
"Energy was committed to managing immediate forms of emotion (such as anger, shock and trauma), as well as seeking to deny aspects of their situation that they could not realistically influence (i.e. their basic state of being incarcerated)" (Crewe et al 2017:538)
"their use of the present was constructive rather than merely depletive." (Crewe et al 2017:538)
"a form of productive agency, in which they sought to make the most of a situation that was not of their choosing, but from which they believed they could derive some personal value" (Crewe et al 2017:538)
The verb 'believed' here is important, and permits the idea that's being put forward here to be separated from the broader social kinds of rehabilitation that someone like Fergus has written about. (note on p.538)
 
"For our participants, it was the profound rupture of the sentence that eventually generated this search for self-understanding and meaning, along with a profound alienation from the self resulting from involvement in an act of murder. It is significant that this quest was often resolved through spiritual or religious practices, or a focus on personal ethics, for these are among the few cultural resources that are available in the context of imprisonment. As Archer notes, "certain intentional human activities, like private prayer, can never be the objects of structural and cultural constraints" (2003, p. 8). The relevance of her framework is thus made apparent: long-term imprisonment involves a decisive dislocation of agent from context, and brings into particularly sharp relief the dynamics of reflexivity, action and constraint" (Crewe et al 2017:538)
This is a point with really big wider implications. It also underlines the need for some degree of forgiveness to be built into the criminal justice system, lest the good work that such people accomplish be undermined by the permanent labelling of them based on their pasts. (note on p.538)
 
"a "determination not to struggle in a futile fashion against that which cannot be overcome, matched by an equal determination not to give internal assent to unacceptable circumstances."" (Crewe et al 2017:539)
It would be worth re-reading O'Donnell's conclusions again, perhaps. (note on p.539)
 
"It seems highly plausible that the nature of both the offense of murder and the exceptionally long sentences that result have a more powerful determining influence than would be found among other prisoner groups" (Crewe et al 2017:539)
This more extended quote is a good one to use as an epigraph, perhaps. (note on p.539)
 
"appear to be more or less flattened by the sheer heft of the act and the severity of the sanction that follows" (Crewe et al 2017:539)
"the fact that prisoners who are deemed to be suffering acute mental health problems are transferred to secure psychiatric hospitals means that our exclusively prison-based sample will exclude those who cope least well with their sentences" (Crewe et al 2017:539)
"while within the prison, a "holistically integrated life," organized around faith or personal idealism may be achievable, outside this context (i.e. post-release), such an orientation to the world may—as Archer suggests—lead to deep disappointment." (Crewe et al 2017:540)
There is something interesting here; that so many of the released lifers I meet display a kind of charming and rather sweet - but ultimately, I think, naive - political optimism about the possibility of radical social change. Is this not simply another product of the social environments that we create, in which people are required to do profound work on the self while being refused any cognizance for the ways in which others may have been responsible for their actions?

	abstract = {While the use of imprisonment continues to rise in developed nations, we have little sociological knowledge of the prison's inner world. Based on extensive fieldwork in a medium-security prison in the UK, HMP Wellingborough, this book provides an in-depth analysis of the prison's social anatomy. It explains how power is exercised by the institution, individualizing the prisoner community and demanding particular forms of compliance and engagement. Drawing on prisoners' life stories, it shows how different prisoners experience and respond to the new range of penal practices and frustrations. It then explains how the prisoner society — its norms, hierarchy, and social relationships — is shaped both by these conditions of confinement and by the different backgrounds, values, and identities that prisoners bring into the prison environment.},

Terms of this kind were used far less often by younger and more recent recruits" (Crewe 2009:61)"Such offi cers rarely expressed pride in the uniform or a strong sense of corporate loyalty: I've never even thought about being proud of it. I just come in, do my work, do whatever I can for other people and go home" (Crewe 2009:61)"The tone of Wellingborough's staff-prisoner relations was set by the benign cohort of its experienced workforce, and was maintained through mundane conversation and censure. Derision was expressed for offi cers who shirked responsibilities, who cherished their power unduly, and who ignored or alienated prisoners" (Crewe 2009:62)"It was in such ways that a basic degree of interpersonal respect was embedded throughout Wellingborough's culture" (Crewe 2009:62)"Relative to other prisons, Wellingborough was not an authoritarian establishment. Offi cers sought to persuade rather than threaten prisoners into everyday compliance, and took satisfaction from the informal relationships that they cultivated. 'Direct orders' were uncommon, reversion to force (through offi cial techniques of 'control and restraint') was rare, and staff did not 'get on your back'" (Crewe 2009:63)"prisoners consistently complained that Wellingborough's regime was restricted and that they had expected 'a bit more freedom' (Connor). Exercise areas were small, there were few opportunities to get fresh air, and prisoners could not mingle on other wings during evening exercise. As in many other Cat-Cs, in the shadow of barbed-wire fences, the prison had large grounds, but these were off-limits to prisoners except in special circumstances" (Crewe 2009:64)"Terms such as 'relaxed' and 'laid back' were also used by offi cers, intimating both the positive and negative aspects of Wellingborough's culture" (Crewe 2009:65)"a reluctance to question established ways of operating" (Crewe 2009:65)"a slightly lethargic culture, in which offi cers were slow to take initiative and resolve problems" (Crewe 2009:65)"Although Wellingborough's offi cer culture was largely benign, this took a passive rather than active form" (Crewe 2009:65)"Wellingborough certainly did" (Crewe 2009:65)"not have a traditional culture of obstruction to reform, antipathy to prisoners, and engrained suspicion of governors. But nor was it a dynamic or purposeful prison, where offi cers were proactive in assisting prisoners—particularly once staff morale began to wane" (Crewe 2009:66)"Many offi cers did little to make themselves available to prisoners. On evening association, staff were rarely seen on the landings and mingled very little with prisoners in recreational areas. Dynamic offi cers stood out against the prevailing culture of the wings. As one highly motivated offi cer commented:11 Certain offi cers are quite content to lean against the radiator all day or sit on a chair [with] a cup of tea. [My view is] If you hear the cell bell going off here, don't just turn it off and then come back in. If you're going to turn it off you've got to answer it. I do fall out with offi cers quite a lot over their lack of enthusiasm" (Crewe 2009:66)"uniformed staff at Wellingborough lacked a vision of 'performance' and 'service-delivery'. Offi cers understood the need for targets, audits, and public sector effi ciency.13 But the majority were either unaware of the targets by which the prison was evaluated, or saw little relationship between these targets and their everyday practices" (Crewe 2009:67)"the cynicism expressed here refl ected an awareness of the creative means with which some targets were achieved" (Crewe 2009:67)"governors were the institutional enforcers of target culture" (Crewe 2009:67)"cynicism was exacerbated by the feeling that targets were being pursued at the expense of staff welfare, and that they were unachievable given the meagre resources being allocated in their pursuit" (Crewe 2009:68)"Offi cers recognized that governors operated under stringent fi nancial constraints and that the prison's staffi ng situation could not be resolved instantaneously. Nonetheless, they felt aggrieved at bearing the burdens of management decisions" (Crewe 2009:68)"As one offi cer protested: 'it's all right them saying, "we know you're one [offi cer] short today, but can you open up and run the wing", because it refl ects on their performance. But they're not the ones actually on the landings, [facing] any repercussions.'" (Crewe 2009:68)"Such protests signalled an emotional climate of under-appreciation, insecurity, neediness, and neurosis more than they refl ected actual risks of physical assault" (Crewe 2009:68)"Wing officers explained the daily struggles of delivering decency: of guaranteeing that non-smokers were not sharing cells with smokers when there was no spare cell capacity, to give a minor example. Decent treatment was easier in theory than practice" (Crewe 2009:70)"Such a statement was telling in indicating the limitations of decency within the prison. Although decent treatment was a takenfor-granted part of Wellingborough's ethos, the defi nition of decency was not explicit, nor was it articulated in moral terms. Little thought was given to why good relations mattered, or how they could be assured in situations when it might be easier to abandon them i.e. when prisoners were abusive or highly demanding. The version of decency that uniformed staff articulated was primarily instrumental: 'if we're talking nicely to each other it's really hard for one of them to break my jaw'" (Crewe 2009:70)"Managerial decisions were seen as zero-sum equations, whereby anything that benefi ted one party worked to the detriment of the other" (Crewe 2009:71)"When feeling collectively undervalued, offi cers thus compared their plight to that of prisoners. One complained that the staff showers had been faulty for several weeks, whereas 'if it'd been this lot, it would've been sorted straightaway'" (Crewe 2009:71)Swaleside sinks and Paul (note on p.71)"There were other indications of a more disrespectful streak within offi cer culture. In backstage areas, offi cers often used highly derogatory language about prisoners, describing them as 'shitbags' or 'arses', and joking about the concerns of vulnerable individuals" (Crewe 2009:71)"Offi cers often discussed the 'mentality' of 'inmates' in highly generic terms, oblivious that they were objectifying the prisoners working silently around them" (Crewe 2009:71)"Many offi cers failed to recognize that banter was often predicated on power differentials, and that such conditions could make it condescending and insulting—an aspect of domination" (Crewe 2009:72)"although offi cers were committed to judging prisoners on the basis of present rather than past behaviour, the corollary of this ethos was that respect was to some degree withheld from prisoners who were diffi cult or abusive" (Crewe 2009:73)"Both prisoners and offi cers saw respect as the outcome of reciprocal behaviour. However each believed that the onus was on the other to set the terms of interpersonal engagement" (Crewe 2009:73)"The lack of solidarity was refl ected in the willingness of offi cers to extend their working hours in order to stem staff shortages, and in the frequency with which some uniformed staff 'went sick' to shirk work or obtain time off. Both were individualistic responses which undermined the potential for collective resistance and only exacerbated the staffi ng crisis for colleagues" (Crewe 2009:74)"most decisions to extend contracted hours resulted from commitments to personal earnings rather than loyalty to the establishment or the Prison Service" (Crewe 2009:75)"The main problems that offi cers reported related not to prisoners, but to senior managers, the Prison Service and the political context" (Crewe 2009:76)"Offi cers also became increasingly reactive, reporting prisoner activity rather than supervising it" (Crewe 2009:77)"When offi cers did come across disciplinary infractions, they used formal authority with inappropriate zeal, giving prisoners 'strikes' instead of using discretion" (Crewe 2009:77)"while offi cers maintained relatively relaxed relations with prisoners, feelings of resignation led them to disengage from interpersonal work and resort to formal power to manage the wings. Retreat was a way of resisting managerial authority and offsetting feelings of powerlessness. In effect, offi cers embraced the role of the faceless turnkey that they felt the job had become, and did so in ways that undermined institutional aims" (Crewe 2009:78)"acts where uniformed staff circumvented approved procedures to meet ends that they felt were otherwise unachievable" (Crewe 2009:79)"Overcrowding and staff discontent placed considerable strain on Wellingborough's functions and relationships.29 Prisoners felt neglected, and were deeply frustrated at the lack of personal offi cer time. Despite Lewis's commitment to curtailing the regime as little as possible, wings could not always be staffed for evening exercise or association. The need to have offi cers in core positions also meant that important but expendable activities such as groupbased drug work, induction talks, and resettlement interviews were often cancelled" (Crewe 2009:79)"Offi cers were proud of their ability to defuse prisoner frustrations and manage under diffi cult circumstances. Yet, in talking up the imminence of prisoner revolt while also quelling it, they highlighted a paradox. Dissent and disturbances were highly undesirable for offi cers, for anger would be directed against them or they would be its frontline victims. Yet in the absence of visible resistance—if the prison remained ostensibly calm, despite lower staffi ng—staff complaints were less likely to be taken seriously" (Crewe 2009:80)viz staff winding up prisoners in Swaleside and Belmarsh. (note on p.80)"Explanations on wing notice boards brusquely cited staff shortages, pointing an accusatory fi nger at management. When prisoners expressed annoyance, offi cers openly endorsed their feelings and vented their own frustrations. These actions testifi ed to the shared interests of those who worked the landings and those who lived on them. They also illustrated a sentiment shared by staff and prisoners that the world beyond the wings was indifferent to their concerns and stacked against their interests" (Crewe 2009:80)"When food was substandard, or when handed-in items were slow to be passed on to prisoners, offi cers encouraged prisoners to lodge offi cial grievances. These were failures of service-delivery, which prisoners felt were not the responsibility of offi cers.31 Prisoners and wing staff recognized that, in many respects, neither had the capacity to solve the problems that most exercised the other" (Crewe 2009:81)"managerial expectations meant that, while his fi nancial and operational discretion contracted, the pressure on him to deliver was heightened. The Prison Service was also 'increasingly demanding of particular ways of doing things', requiring that offending behaviour programmes were homogenous and accredited, and imposing orders and instructions from above on all manner of policies and practices" (Crewe 2009:82)"power operated through personnel at all levels. For both governors and offi cers," (Crewe 2009:82)"as much as power was exercised, it often felt 'elsewhere' and was never truly in their possession" (Crewe 2009:83)"Lewis's declaration of powerlessness resonated in striking ways with prisoners' complaints about the elusiveness and anonymity of penal power, as coming chapters will show. It illustrated the way that, as for offi cers, managerialism could feel harsh and oppressive to those who were its institutional representatives" (Crewe 2009:83)"Such pleas for empathy indicated the possibility of understanding between prisoners and their custodians. But the supplication of" (Crewe 2009:83)"governors to prisoners was born of weakness, not the search for normative consensus as such. At the same time, it pointed to an alliance of interests within the institution: not divisions between different strata in the prison, but a line of division between the institution and the world above it." (Crewe 2009:84)"Despite their frustrations and reservations, then, governors were highly compliant in the face of managerial power" (Crewe 2009:84)"As suggested here, by running the prison 'effectively' (i.e. keeping within the budget, meeting targets, maintaining the regime), and fulfi lling a particular vision of institutional success, governors could perpetuate problems that edged beneath the managerialist radar, and could foment frustrations that would return to haunt them" (Crewe 2009:85)"The distribution of power in Wellingborough made it possible for governors to suppress staff discontent, or push it into forms (such as staff sickness) that remained 'managerial' rather than systemic problems" (Crewe 2009:85)"despite their enormous capacity to determine the quality of prison life for prisoners, uniformed staff did not perceive themselves to be powerful fi gures in institutional life. As a group, they were demoralized and fragmented. Managerial reforms had winched power to higher levels of the organization, eroding their collective infl uence. Many offi cers felt un-trusted, out of touch with institutional aims, and alienated from organizational decision-making. Cynicism about management motives and methods was widespread. Resentment was partly based on a feeling that managers cared more about prisoner wellbeing than staff concerns, and were fi xated on (what were considered) abstract and meaningless 'targets' while indifferent to the nature of the 'real work' that took place on the landings" (Crewe 2009:86)"staff expressed their discontent by disengaging from interpersonal work or going sick" (Crewe 2009:86)"governors felt little more autonomous and barely more in control of the institutional agenda" (Crewe 2009:86)"governors and offi cers felt equally disempowered by the absence of visible discontent among prisoners. These pervasive feelings of powerlessness were intensifi ed by the knowledge that, by coping in diffi cult circumstances, one's problems were more likely to be perpetuated than resolved" (Crewe 2009:87)"Uniformed staff expressed as much hostility and cynicism about governors as they did about prisoners (see Liebling 2004), with whom they shared space and developed tacit alliances through a shared perception of managerial neglect" (Crewe 2009:87)"Centralized control had been tightened in part because of the moral defi ciencies and abuses that a less fi rmly managed system had allowed in previous decades. Senior managers justifi ed increased scrutiny and accountability by arguing that imprisonment, more than other domains, necessitated rather autocratic management, not so much of prisoners but staff. Inevitably though, the layers of audit that this view produces can imply a lack of faith in the expertise of professionals, who often felt restricted, controlled, and disempowered even while they recognized the benefi ts of oversight" (Crewe 2009:88)"questions should be asked about what counts integrity (see Cohen and Taylor 1972; as resistance as opposed to survival, coping or the maintenance of mental and physical Buntman 2003)" (Crewe 2009:107)"The pursuit of education is a completely different thing depending on whether it fulfi ls or subverts institutional aims" (Crewe 2009:107)this is a really useful distinction to remember in considering ethical projects and self-formation. (note on p.107)"Buntman's (2003: 237) characterization of resistance as 'actions and practices designed to dilute, circumvent, or eliminate the imposition of unwelcome power' is thus a useful baseline defi nition, allowing at least some consideration of intentions, outcomes, and the dialectic of power between dominant and subordinate parties" (Crewe 2009:107)Again, a good one to remember and re-use. (note on p.107)"the most extreme position 'repudiates the principles by which the dominant stratum justifi es its dominance'" (Crewe 2009:107)Is this the kind of thing being done by the eremitical tendencies among prisoners, denying the value of material things? (note on p.107)"forms of individual resistance require social support or toleration, and whether they aggregate depends on social factors such as the extent to which subordinates are mutually dependent and socially cohesive, share a common experience of domination, and can change their status by other means" (Crewe 2009:107)Hence BL's work is an isolated and therefore atomised act of resistance? (note on p.107)"the refocusing of priorities towards risk reduction and public protection was ever more conspicuous, channelling rehabilitative impulses into particular forms. Discourses of welfarism and decency, authority and control, and personal responsibility and accountability thus co-existed not just within the same system, but, as this chapter will elaborate, within specifi c policies, creating a particular formation of power on the prison landings" (Crewe 2009:108)"offi cers were not necessarily proactive in their pursuit of prisoner welfare, but neither did they seek to antagonize or humiliate prisoners or completely ignore their concerns" (Crewe 2009:110)"managerialist reforms have relocated power to higher levels of the prison (see also Bryans 2007). Strategies of audit and centralized command have enhanced control over the lower levels of the organization (Liebling 2004; Carlen 2005; Cheliotis 2006). To a much greater degree, prisons are 'run to policy'" (Crewe 2009:111)"judgments about recategorization and release were based partly on feedback from wing staff. Ultimately too though, these decisions were made at higher levels and were infl uenced most by input from specialist staff such as psychologists and probation offi cers" (Crewe 2009:113)"Power fl owed through offi cers, and the way in which they used it was a principal determinant of the prison's legitimacy and survivability (see Liebling 2004; Sparks et al. 1996), but they were not its ultimate possessors" (Crewe 2009:113)"Although attitudes to offi cers varied—as Chapter 6 explains in more detail—criticism rarely targeted their collective use of power or tarnished them in blanket terms. Rather, it refl ected individual behaviour, their role in systemic failings and their status as representatives of authority" (Crewe 2009:113)"At the same time as their collective infl uence within penal organizations has diminished, as the 'street-level bureaucrats' of the system (Lipsky 1983), offi cers still wielded considerable discretionary authority" (Crewe 2009:114)"'what escapes the supervisory gaze of the "system", no matter how Orwellian that may be, is the panoply of personal values and idiosyncratic meanings that individual decision-makers bring to their decisions'" (Crewe 2009:114)"Discretion can function for or against legitimacy (Liebling 2000). At times, it was employed to bypass ineffi ciencies, enable prisoners to back down from confrontation without losing face, reduce needless tensions, and to make exceptions for prisoners who were vulnerable.13 In such ways, offi cers" (Crewe 2009:114)"both underand over-used the legal power at their disposal in ways that were consistent with notions of natural justice" (Crewe 2009:115)"uncertainty and ambiguity were intrinsic features of the 'sticky' relationships between prisoners and staff that modern policies encouraged. Since offi cers differed in their use of authority, with some more inclined than others to grant small favours, chase up requests, and help with job placements, positive relationships with staff could be highly benefi cial to a prisoner's living standards. And since prisoners also relied on staff for privilege decisions and wing reports, the dynamic between staff and prisoners was far from one of pure voluntarism." (Crewe 2009:115)"In certain respects, for prisoners, the incitement to interact with staff functioned coercively. If one wanted to progress, getting on with staff was less a matter of choice than compulsion. The relationships this invited could thus be instrumental, disingenuous, and highly unstable" (Crewe 2009:116)"Such comments recognized a tension between the enhancement of legitimacy achieved by penal reforms and the coercive dimensions of incentive schemes that granted benefi ts in ways that were conditional and differentiated" (Crewe 2009:117)"Meanwhile, the linking of opportunities with compliance extended the amount and intensity of power available to the prison authorities. 'They can hit you with a stick a lot fuckin harder', said Matt, 'they've got more stick to wield'. Prison offi cers in particular were empowered by their role in the IEP process. For prisoners, the more signifi cant factor was the smooth effi ciency of this power: the way it worked upon their material desires" (Crewe 2009:118)"Most offi cers acknowledged the coercive potential of incentives, in the sense that they knew they were effective levers for ensuring prisoner compliance. Yet they also considered the IEP scheme to be excessively generous" (Crewe 2009:118)"being an 'enhanced' prisoner was not only an incentive in itself—a source of current provision (in-cell" (Crewe 2009:118)"television, extra visits, association time, etc). It was also desirable because it represented an offi cial status label that helped accelerate the journey towards freedom: 'It looks better on my record later on' (Stephen). Since these inducements could be withheld or withdrawn, and progress towards release could thus be slowed, the might of the stick and the appeal of the carrot could not easily be separated" (Crewe 2009:119)"the authoritarian prison of the past was oppressive but predictable. In comparison, modern imprisonment was less restrictive but more diffi cult to navigate" (Crewe 2009:119)"a bygone culture that was harsher but less ambiguous. In the words of one governor: 'the line was well drawn, and if the prisoner overstepped the line, he would suffer the consequences. There was very little consideration, it never wavered. But it also meant there were less areas of confl ict" (Crewe 2009:119)"The idea of bureaucratic rule is that power is applied more fairly and that 'penal decisions [are] more easily subjected to the various demands for accountability' (Aas 2004: 384). In Wellingborough, however, its application was typical of frontline bureaucracies, with rules employed and procedures explained in ways that were often erratic and inconsistent" (Crewe 2009:120)"Such quotations highlighted the ontological insecurities that discretion could engender, and which rendered the external environment unreliable and unpredictable" (Crewe 2009:120)"In the eyes of prisoners, the logic of decision-making was often opaque, and seemed to depend on personal relationships with staff" (Crewe 2009:120)"Tommy's quotation pointed to the comfort that could be taken from the certainty of low expectations. Discretion required faith in others; pure authority made no promise that hope was worthwhile" (Crewe 2009:121)"For other prisoners, power was not imperceptible but intangible. It operated from locations that made it almost impossible to affect" (Crewe 2009:121)"It was in this respect, as a bureaucratic machine, that authority was encountered as an immoveable 'wall'. The system appeared faceless, and its decisions (e.g. about home leave or a prisoner's right to personal property) felt almost impossible to challenge through interpersonal negotiation or direct appeals to humanity" (Crewe 2009:122)"Dealings with this systemic machinery were fraught with diffi culty. The advantages of bureaucratic procedures should not be overlooked, in terms of the relative transparency and consistency that they can achieve, and the formal opportunities they provide for prisoners to pursue grievances. In practice, however, 'paperwork' was the institutional black hole into which problems could be cast without further explanation. Decisions about job allocations and early release were often simply attributed to 'security', with little further explanation but with signifi cant and enduring consequences. Prisoners were left with little certainty of what such terms meant and what could be done to address them. Processes were complicated and long-winded. Requests, complaints, and applications passed through a number of institutional hands before resolution, but prisoners were often left with little sense of their progress" (Crewe 2009:122)Swaleside OMU (note on p.122)"For offi cers, this was exploitable territory. Once Wellingborough's wing staff had retreated from informal contact with prisoners, and increasingly dealt with prisoner concerns through formal channels, they could absolve themselves of responsibility for inactivity by hiding in the shadows of the bureaucratic process. By encouraging prisoners to use applications, shovelling work to higher levels, or falsely claiming to have passed work to appropriate personnel in order to buy themselves time, they overstated their powerlessness in ways that prisoners could do little to challenge. Those mechanisms designed to enhance legitimacy served instead to create feelings of frustration and fatalism" (Crewe 2009:123)"contemporary power had a less reliable quality" (Crewe 2009:123)"power was indirect, operating 'behind your back' rather than through face-to-face contact. For many prisoners, as with discretionary inconsistency, this was experienced as a form of dishonesty and 'disrespect'—a sly and unmanly form of power" (Crewe 2009:124)"Second, power was deferred, with delayed repercussions that could not be anticipated. Confl icts could end, yet their effects (in terms of privilege level or sentence progression) could persist: 'if you cause an argument', said Asif, 'you're not going to get what you want later out of the sentence'. In claiming, however hyperbolically, that staff violence was preferable to being 'killed off on fi le', prisoners emphasized the difference between punishments that were immediate, predictable and short-lived in their consequences, and those whose outcomes were long-lasting or took effect at an unpredictable point in the future" (Crewe 2009:124)Truer of lifers than anyone. (note on p.124)"As is consistent with the punitive turn, this renaissance in rehabilitative provision is oriented to public security, with prisoners' psychological 'needs' narrowly defi ned according to what is deemed desirable for the public rather than what prisoners might require to enhance their psychological wellbeing or address their social needs" (Crewe 2009:125)"the role of psychologists in the alleviation of psychological distress and the promotion of individual wellbeing is limited. Psychiatric and counselling services are available to prisoners with severe mental health problems, but these services are highly limited (in Wellingborough, a consultant psychiatrist attended the prison one day per week)" (Crewe 2009:126)"Parole Board reviews also determined whether early release would be granted to prisoners with fi xed sentences of over four years. However, prisoners with such terms were unlikely to have the kinds of individual assessments with psychologists that lifers underwent. For these prisoners, as for lifers and prisoners on shorter-sentences, psychological judgments were expressed primarily through reports submitted by treatment managers—often but not always psychologists—after the completion of offending behaviour courses. Likewise, prisoners on non-parole sentences were unlikely to have contact with psychology staff outside the context of such programmes (for example, the 'Reasoning and Rehabilitation' course). For such prisoners, references to 'psychology' were shorthand for the reports presented by uniformed staff, workshop instructors, probation offi cers, and other staff at institutional hearings to determine IEP, recategorization, home leave, or HDC decisions.20 Psychological power, then, entailed the set of written submissions that, for all prisoners, structured the path towards freedom" (Crewe 2009:127)"21 The shift in concern from prisoner welfare to public protection positioned almost all specialist staff as agents of an extensive and repressive network of disciplinary power" (Crewe 2009:128)"the dispersal of power away from the wings did not represent its repeal or dissipation so much as its diffusion and expansion. In terms of specialist expertise and assistance, prisoners had very few allies or outlets. Few members of staff were exempted from suspicion and mistrust. Signifi cantly, although those who were excluded—education staff, CARAT workers, and members" (Crewe 2009:128)"of the chaplaincy—could contribute to reports used in parole decisions and were able to place prisoners on disciplinary charges, their roles within the prison were explicitly welfare-oriented and they spoke a distinctive language of care, concern, and individual wellbeing" (Crewe 2009:129)"Psychologists were not accorded the same value. Most prisoners had little objection to psychological insight per se. A large proportion expressed concerns about mental health issues and longed for help to deal with deep-rooted personal problems such as bereavements and childhood abuse, and with the psychological roots of their offending behaviour. Indeed, many prisoners embraced a terminology of 'criminogenic need' that indicated their absorption of institutional discourse. These prisoners located their problems in personal cognition, and yearned for a kind of correctional injection that would cure their 'defects'. Other prisoners were less subsumed by offi cial discourse, but questioned their psychological health or moral core—' . . . what kind of person I am'. These men sought diagnoses that could provide insight into their personalities and patterns of crime.23 Yet, as George explained, the opportunities to explore and address these issues outside the boundaries of institutional power were limited" (Crewe 2009:130)"Personal problems—alcoholism, schizophrenia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecifi ed anger—were quickly subsumed into institutional discourse, and transformed from needs to risks in the interests of public protection (see HannahMoffat 2005). This focus left gaping holes in therapeutic provision, and provided a stark symbolic message to prisoners about their debased social status" (Crewe 2009:130)"the strength and direction of feeling about psychological power—which was highly intense and almost universally negative—was related to its form and reach" (Crewe 2009:131)"When it comes to probation and psychology, because it's not to do with the day-to-day things, it's to do with the effects on your life, the effects of you getting out, it's a deeper type of power [from] the every day situation: I think it's felt more profoundly" (Crewe 2009:131)"the force of psychological power lay in its capacity to determine future plans and possibilities. Rather than appropriating the past, like the traditional sentence, it predicted and prevented possible futures. In this respect, it was a form of 'pre-punishment'" (Crewe 2009:131)"Nathan's observation also signalled the difference between a form of authority that was at least broadly knowable and predictable, and (as with bureaucratic power) a mode of power that was much harder to decipher. Although prisoners understood the general factors that fed into parole decisions and risk assessments—most importantly, whether progress had been made in addressing risk factors and the causes of offending behaviour— the formulae by which such decisions were made were so imprecise as to render the process highly obscure" (Crewe 2009:132)"As Aas (2004) has argued, unstructured professional knowledge has come to be seen as a source of unpredictability and disorder. Subjectivity remains an issue, however. First, psychologists make choices about which assessment tools to employ; second, inputting data into structured models still requires a degree of 'translation' and often relies on personal judgments (for example, whether a prisoner is 'promiscuous' or has had 'many' short-term sexual relationships) (Crighton 2005); third, with tools such as the revised psychopathy checklist (PCL-R), there is no consensus on what score marks the boundary between normal and classifi able behaviour; fourth, diagnostic conclusions still need to be related to a prisoner's risk of reoffending rather than seen in isolation; fi nally, because even the most reliable tools produce a large number of false positives and false negatives—prisoners caught in the diagnostic net who are not real risks, and those who get through the diagnostic fi lter but do reoffend" (Crewe 2009:132)"That psychological power had such infl uence but also such subjective dimensions made its authority all the harder for many prisoners to accept" (Crewe 2009:133)"Many trainee psychologists and psychological assistants were 'young white women predominately from higher socio-economic groups'" (Crewe 2009:133)"More often, prisoners were simply sceptical of the diagnostic expertise of junior psychology staff, and struggled to take direction from course tutors who they felt had little life experience: 'they know nothing about drugs, or the reasons for taking drugs. They're trying to teach you something that you know back to front and they know nothing about'" (Crewe 2009:133)"many prisoners felt like mere objects to be fed into the institutional machinery" (Crewe 2009:134)"Pete drew attention to the difference between conforming to the rules of an institution and adhering to the laws of society. Prisoners who queried orders, questioned staff authority, or did not assent meekly to the terms of the system (often having been taught assertiveness skills in prison courses) and then found themselves described in wing reports as aggressive or refractory saw no necessary relationship between such behaviours and the notions of 'risk to life and limb' around which assessments were meant to be based. Like Pete, they emphasized the prison's responsibility for inciting their assertions, for provoking their frustrations, and for socializing them into hardened and forceful identities over the course of long sentences. For these prisoners, the distorted environment of the prison bore little relation to the world outside and was an inadequate laboratory in which to gauge their behaviour" (Crewe 2009:134)"Whether a 'neat and tidy cell'—the kind of thing that an offi cer might include in a report—was an indication of healthy self-respect or excessive self-control was a complex matter. The degree to which such matters were relevant to 'risk' depended on the particular prisoner and his offending history. Likewise, psychologists would primarily be interested in whether a prisoner was involved in drug culture if drugs were related to his offending behaviour, or if he were insisting that he no longer had anything to do with drugs" (Crewe 2009:135)"Whether or not offi cers' speculations were discounted, and regardless of the sophistication with which psychologists sifted information about in-prison behaviour, the impact of psychological power was the same: most prisoners felt that all areas of their life—the people with whom they walked on the exercise" (Crewe 2009:135)"yard, how they socialized with other prisoners and staff, the posters they had on their walls, their reading material, whether they received visits, who they wrote to, their interests and aspirations—were baselessly under scrutiny, and regulated themselves accordingly" (Crewe 2009:136)"Again, the point here is not to judge the integrity of these decisions— although there was little doubt that governors exercised discretion in ways that made decisions inconsistent and potentially extra-legal (see Scott 2006)28 —but to draw attention to how their terms were perceived on the wings. In this respect, psychological power lacked the very transparency and accountability that bureaucratic government is supposed to advance" (Crewe 2009:136)"passive compliance had little bearing on risk reduction and did not match the institutional template of ideal behaviour" (Crewe 2009:136)"The likelihood here was that the Parole Board had not insisted that further courses needed to be sat, but that, to diminish risk suffi - ciently, Darren needed to engage in work that went beyond what cognitive programmes could provide (for example, one-to-one interventions or drug-counselling). That Darren had confl ated these recommendations was precisely the point: the institutional fi xation on structured group-work meant that, to prisoners, 'courses' were the keystone of release. At times, the enforced demand to get onto courses had an almost hysterical feel" (Crewe 2009:137)"Tommy had been given a label—of not being suffi ciently open or honest—that continued to hold back his release, and which, from his perspective, bore no relation to proper considerations of risk: Everything should centre on whether you're a risk to the public. If you're not, they've no grounds to keep you in. With me, they're saying that the likelihood of me committing any offence is very low. I'm not a risk. Yet the answer they give me this time is that I've got to go back to Cat-D conditions because [of what happened] six years ago. And I can't accept that answer. . . . I'm being judged on moral and social issues, rather than risk" (Crewe 2009:138)"Its logic was preventive, calculating into the future rather than on the basis of past behaviour. In this respect, psychological power was highly unforgiving" (Crewe 2009:138)"Once committed to fi le, negative assessments and comments could not be erased, and tainted judgments of future acts while overshadowing routine positive behaviour. As one psychologist noted, anything on record had to be addressed, regardless of whether it would show up in a present assessment: 'once you refer someone onto a programme, that's on their record, and if they don't do it the reference is still there: "why didn't you do that in 1993 when it was offered to you?"'. Diagnostic records, as well as 'security fi les', were highly adhesive and therefore highly enduring" (Crewe 2009:138)"Prisoners who were prepared to make concerted and visible efforts to show expiation or reform could appear transformed. As Tyler suggested though, those unwilling to make such exertions had few means of illustrating change through their routine conduct. Small acts of anger caused damage that sustained patience could not necessarily repair. In these respects, psychological power was also highly absolutist. It offered little clemency for human errors which—as in Tommy's case—were hard to equate with criminal risk, and it left little room for ambivalence or ambiguity. Files did not always place acts in the context of prison life—with all its stresses and temptations—or personal narratives, with their developmental complexities" (Crewe 2009:139)"To express legitimate and realistic concerns about being dragged back into reoffending or about forming relationships on release was to place one's freedom in jeopardy. This was particularly the case if 'protective strategies' were unavailable to manage the basis of a prisoner's anxieties i.e. if there were no courses available to address his particular issues. Thus, regardless of a prisoner's own efforts, limits to institutional resources and psychological knowledge could inhibit his chances of release" (Crewe 2009:139)"The identities that they presented to psychologists were more confi dent and secure than their inner realities" (Crewe 2009:140)"Prisoners complained that wing fi les presented 'one-sided' and questionable accounts of incidents, without allowing the opportunity for rectifi cation" (Crewe 2009:140)"Although psychological judgments functioned primarily to defi ne prisoners' futures, they also had signifi cant and insidious effects on their current lives" (Crewe 2009:140)"The system has forced me to draw to their level, how they see things and deal with things, rather than helping me deal with things in my own way, in my own personality, in my own mistakes, weaknesses, diffi culties. They've taken me off that road, and forced their opinion, their understanding onto me. . . . They're only interested in their own decision-making. You go through [your] sentence, and everybody's telling you to be open and honest, and when you do, they don't believe you. Their truth they can handle. Not the prisoner's truth." (Crewe 2009:140)"life histories were required to fi t into parameters provided by the database and the abstract vocabulary that standardization necessitated (Aas 2004). For long-term prisoners, for whom maintaining some control over personal integrity and identity was a paramount concern (Cohen and Taylor 1972; and see Chapter 7), to have one's experience and identity 'formalized and institutionalized' (George) in these ways was a pain of major signifi cance. For long-term prisoners, psychological processes such as these were among the mortifi cations and abasements of the modern prison" (Crewe 2009:141)"There was little room to negotiate such terms or present alternative interpretations of past actions. Prisoners had various means of challenging psychological assessments: by correcting factual inaccuracies, by making their own representations to the Parole Board, by obtaining assessments from external (non-Prison Service) psychologists, and by disputing directly the conclusions of psychology staff. However, such strategies were limited in effect and potentially hazardous" (Crewe 2009:141)"the power that they wielded made such accounts highly risky and hindered truthful disclosure" (Crewe 2009:142)"I've never told anyone all this before" (note on p.142)"Given the prevailing institutional language, alternative representations were in effect unintelligible. As Foucault argues (1977), resistance becomes seen as 'unrecognizable', irrational behaviour, part of the justifi cation for further treatment" (Crewe 2009:142)SB (note on p.142)"Other prisoners complained along similar lines. If they were honest about not regretting their crimes, they were less likely to obtain parole; but if they second-guessed institutional discourse they could be caught out by their lies" (Crewe 2009:142)"31 Interventions were thus limited by a logic that was managerial and pragmatic (Thomas-Peter 2006). Long-term, humanistic, psychological therapies were unsuitable for this framework (Crighton 2006), and many prisoners fell outside the borders of provision. In relation to the R\&R course, this group included offenders with severe learning diffi culties or severe psychological disorders" (Crewe 2009:143)"Within the institution, offi cial discourse showed little awareness of either the fallibility or impact of psychological discourse (see Fox 1999). In contrast, senior Prison Service psychologists were aware of the problems of uncritically celebrating the discipline's ascendance within late-modern corrections—the dangers of a narrow approach to rehabilitation, of relatively unfettered power, of dividing offenders' problems 'into those we have an intention to change and those we do not' (Thomas-Peter 2006: 34). Likewise, they recognized the risks of treating prisoners as objects rather than subjects, and bearing a veil of noble intervention that masked a culture in which the real needs of offenders were often buried beneath calls for public protection at all costs. One psychologist summarized such fears thus: I think that when we were a small number of staff and didn't do programmes left, right and centre, as a professional group we had a much better grasp of the professional requirement for us to manage that power imbalance—the things you can do to try to make it better, even though it's always going be there. I think now that we put prisoners through programmes, we do to prisoners a lot more, we don't do with prisoners" (Crewe 2009:144)"Programme content was demanding and ideologically rigid, as some facilitators acknowledged. Role-plays assumed a rational-choice agent, unconstrained by, or resistant to, the kinds of pressures that dominated the cultures and communities to which prisoners would return—pressures to maintain 'face' and 'reputation', not to back down in the face of provocation, and never to appear passive" (Crewe 2009:144)"you can't be seen as being given your own view, you have to [take] their view. And I can't comply like that. There's too many ifs, whats, and buts to everything" (Crewe 2009:145)"To meet bureaucratic imperatives, compliance needed to be visibly demonstrated and formally recorded, almost regardless of its underlying sincerity" (Crewe 2009:146)"The model performance over the course of a programme was one of personal progress and transformation (see Fox 1999). The ideal subject was the prisoner capable of being emancipated from his unthinking, irrational, wayward self into the rational self-governing agent that lay within. In essence then, cognitive group-work addressed the offender by appealing to an essential 'good side' that its selection policy ensured was amenable. Those whose rationality was already considered defi cient or who were irredeemably 'misguided' were excluded from participation. This logic, whereby prisoners were liberated from their own irrational interests for the sake of a wider majority, represented a form of authoritarian paternalism" (Crewe 2009:146)Brilliant (note on p.146)"If you don't do them, they hold that over you. . . . I wouldn't do R and R, [and they said] that I wasn't complying with the rules of the system. But it's not in the rules to do R and R. As soon as you go there, they tell you it's voluntary" (Crewe 2009:146)"You used to be just left to your own devices. It was less comfortable but you had more freedom. You didn't have all these fucking Reasoning and Rehabilitation and all these drug courses and all that. As long as you didn't give them no bother, they didn't care. They'd just move you through the system, for an easy life. This was a penal doctrine that, while authoritarian and exacting in policing disobedience, made little attempt to penetrate the mind or target the psyche" (Crewe 2009:147)"Here, the 'buffer zone' between the prisoner and the bare face of staff control was the sphere where the captive was expected to" (Crewe 2009:147)"self-govern without direct intervention" (Crewe 2009:148)"The transfer of responsibility from the institution to the individual is highly signifi cant, and represents a shift in the rationality of crime control (Hannah-Moffat 2001; 2005; Kruttschnitt and Gartner 2005; Garland 1997). Prisoners have always 'selfgoverned' to some degree, to disguise illicit activity or reduce the points of friction with the institution. But this imperative has intensifi ed, giving the achievement of order an apparently automatic quality" (Crewe 2009:148)"As Darren highlighted, prisoners were not subjected to orders so much as the agents of their own incarceration" (Crewe 2009:148)"Before you just did your time and you got out. There was nothing required of you, except to go to work. Whereas now it's down to the slightest little thing, it's all tied in. Like there's a notice out there, 'don't fi ll a bucket from the hot water tap or you get a strike' You get three strikes, you're knocked down a level, you might lose your TV, [or] a couple of visits. Right down to the slightest little thing, it's all tied in to your behaviour. So right down to the sort of tiniest sort of forms of behaviour, it's all monitored; it's all tied in to your future" (Crewe 2009:149)"Since aspirations and desires were the basis of control, any inability to conform to the prison's expectations could be experienced as a form of self-denial—a failing in individual self-control as much as in institutional effectiveness. Meanwhile, the provision of cognitive behavioural courses designed to 'teach' responsibility reassigned liability for misbehaviour from the prison to the prisoner. 'They can say "well, he's had the opportunity, if he hasn't" (Crewe 2009:149)"learned, it ain't our fault"'" (Crewe 2009:150)"prisoners were required to demonstrate an active commitment to change and to engage with the system as enthusiastic partners in its project" (Crewe 2009:150)"For some prisoners, this demand for engagement was an advanced form of oppression. It represented the extension of control from the body to the mind and 'soul'. The logic of being punished for doing something wrong was easier to accept than the requirement to cultivate a certain kind of committed persona" (Crewe 2009:150)"Jordan identifi ed a fundamental shift in the kind of liberty that the prison provided. Prisons of the 1970s and '80s were generally highly authoritarian, and, despite an offi cial discourse of 'training', welfare and rehabilitation, most offered little constructive activity and few meaningful opportunities for self-development. 'Positive liberty' (Berlin 1969), opportunities for self-realization and empowerment, was pitifully low. At the same time, within the prisoner world, 'negative liberty' (ibid.), the freedom from interference, was relatively hig" (Crewe 2009:150)"there is less negative liberty, both in physical and psychological terms" (Crewe 2009:151)"an increasing number of psychological obstacles that prisoners must negotiate to attain their freedom with maximum speed" (Crewe 2009:151)"In the prison, the discourse of public protection makes it easier not only to judge certain individuals as irrational, irresponsible or lacking in good judgment, but to justify violations of liberty and intrusions into private life that would be considered illegitimate elsewhere" (Crewe 2009:153)"imprisonment was not experienced as a coercive imposition by those prisoners whose subjectivities were successfully engaged, harnessed, or transformed by institutional mechanisms. Its qualities were soft and unobtrusive. But noncompliance soon led to punitive sanctions (e.g. the denial of open visits, additions to the sentence, transfers to higher-security establishments). Resistant individuals were held responsible for behaviours that were indicative of poor self-governance and for breaking 'compacts' with the institution that they were given no option but to sign" (Crewe 2009:153)"There was little room for trust, for prisoners meaningfully to contest how their best interests were defi ned or to challenge the relative weight given to public interests over personal rights" (Crewe 2009:154)This is a really useful table. Use as basis for comparative notes in noting Swaleside and Leyhill. (note on p.155)Yes, though at Swaleside the body and behaviour remain very much of relevance since they are where the soul, however spuriously, is read.​ (note on p.156)"Power of one kind has been removed from the wings—it would be insuffi cient now to assert that 'life in prison is essentially on the landings' (McDermott and King 1988: 359).

"The aim of this chapter is to take a step from the general to the specifi c—to move from policy abstractions, offi cial declarations and matters of context to more concrete issues of how power and culture took shape in the prison" (Crewe 2009:1)
"Wellingborough's uniformed workforce was well balanced in terms of age, with some notable differences between the orientations of staff of different experience" (Crewe 2009:2)
"older offi cers were nostalgic for an earlier era of imprisonment and for the clear lines of authority of the past" (Crewe 2009:2)
"Despite these views, they were not the brusque, indifferent 'dinosaurs' dominant in many establishments, nor the 'hardline' staff who imposed rules to the letter" (Crewe 2009:2)
"They bemoaned the inexperience of younger offi cers, who they saw as socially naïve, careless in their use of authority, and incapable of using discretion appropriately" (Crewe 2009:2)
"Such offi cers saw their work in vocational terms, as a 'job for life'—an attitude that could engender loyalty but could also signify a somewhat static notion of what the job should entail. Terms of this kind were used far less often by younger and more recent recruits" (Crewe 2009:3)
"Such offi cers rarely expressed pride in the uniform or a strong sense of corporate loyalty: I've never even thought about being proud of it. I just come in, do my work, do whatever I can for other people and go home" (Crewe 2009:3)
"The tone of Wellingborough's staff-prisoner relations was set by the benign cohort of its experienced workforce, and was maintained through mundane conversation and censure. Derision was expressed for offi cers who shirked responsibilities, who cherished their power unduly, and who ignored or alienated prisoners" (Crewe 2009:4)
"It was in such ways that a basic degree of interpersonal respect was embedded throughout Wellingborough's culture" (Crewe 2009:4)
"Relative to other prisons, Wellingborough was not an authoritarian establishment. Offi cers sought to persuade rather than threaten prisoners into everyday compliance, and took satisfaction from the informal relationships that they cultivated. 'Direct orders' were uncommon, reversion to force (through offi cial techniques of 'control and restraint') was rare, and staff did not 'get on your back'" (Crewe 2009:5)
"prisoners consistently complained that Wellingborough's regime was restricted and that they had expected 'a bit more freedom' (Connor). Exercise areas were small, there were few opportunities to get fresh air, and prisoners could not mingle on other wings during evening exercise. As in many other Cat-Cs, in the shadow of barbed-wire fences, the prison had large grounds, but these were off-limits to prisoners except in special circumstances" (Crewe 2009:6)
"Terms such as 'relaxed' and 'laid back' were also used by offi cers, intimating both the positive and negative aspects of Wellingborough's culture" (Crewe 2009:7)
"a reluctance to question established ways of operating" (Crewe 2009:7)
"a slightly lethargic culture, in which offi cers were slow to take initiative and resolve problems" (Crewe 2009:7)
"Although Wellingborough's offi cer culture was largely benign, this took a passive rather than active form" (Crewe 2009:7)
"Wellingborough certainly did" (Crewe 2009:7)
"not have a traditional culture of obstruction to reform, antipathy to prisoners, and engrained suspicion of governors. But nor was it a dynamic or purposeful prison, where offi cers were proactive in assisting prisoners—particularly once staff morale began to wane" (Crewe 2009:8)
"Many offi cers did little to make themselves available to prisoners. On evening association, staff were rarely seen on the landings and mingled very little with prisoners in recreational areas. Dynamic offi cers stood out against the prevailing culture of the wings. As one highly motivated offi cer commented:11 Certain offi cers are quite content to lean against the radiator all day or sit on a chair [with] a cup of tea. [My view is] If you hear the cell bell going off here, don't just turn it off and then come back in. If you're going to turn it off you've got to answer it. I do fall out with offi cers quite a lot over their lack of enthusiasm" (Crewe 2009:8)
"uniformed staff at Wellingborough lacked a vision of 'performance' and 'service-delivery'. Offi cers understood the need for targets, audits, and public sector effi ciency.13 But the majority were either unaware of the targets by which the prison was evaluated, or saw little relationship between these targets and their everyday practices" (Crewe 2009:9)
"the cynicism expressed here refl ected an awareness of the creative means with which some targets were achieved" (Crewe 2009:9)
"governors were the institutional enforcers of target culture" (Crewe 2009:9)
"cynicism was exacerbated by the feeling that targets were being pursued at the expense of staff welfare, and that they were unachievable given the meagre resources being allocated in their pursuit" (Crewe 2009:10)
"Offi cers recognized that governors operated under stringent fi nancial constraints and that the prison's staffi ng situation could not be resolved instantaneously. Nonetheless, they felt aggrieved at bearing the burdens of management decisions" (Crewe 2009:10)
"As one offi cer protested: 'it's all right them saying, "we know you're one [offi cer] short today, but can you open up and run the wing", because it refl ects on their performance. But they're not the ones actually on the landings, [facing] any repercussions.'" (Crewe 2009:10)
"Such protests signalled an emotional climate of under-appreciation, insecurity, neediness, and neurosis more than they refl ected actual risks of physical assault" (Crewe 2009:10)
"Wing officers explained the daily struggles of delivering decency: of guaranteeing that non-smokers were not sharing cells with smokers when there was no spare cell capacity, to give a minor example. Decent treatment was easier in theory than practice" (Crewe 2009:12)
"Such a statement was telling in indicating the limitations of decency within the prison. Although decent treatment was a takenfor-granted part of Wellingborough's ethos, the defi nition of decency was not explicit, nor was it articulated in moral terms. Little thought was given to why good relations mattered, or how they could be assured in situations when it might be easier to abandon them i.e. when prisoners were abusive or highly demanding. The version of decency that uniformed staff articulated was primarily instrumental: 'if we're talking nicely to each other it's really hard for one of them to break my jaw'" (Crewe 2009:12)
"Managerial decisions were seen as zero-sum equations, whereby anything that benefi ted one party worked to the detriment of the other" (Crewe 2009:13)
"When feeling collectively undervalued, offi cers thus compared their plight to that of prisoners. One complained that the staff showers had been faulty for several weeks, whereas 'if it'd been this lot, it would've been sorted straightaway'" (Crewe 2009:13)
Swaleside sinks and Paul (note on p.13)
 
"There were other indications of a more disrespectful streak within offi cer culture. In backstage areas, offi cers often used highly derogatory language about prisoners, describing them as 'shitbags' or 'arses', and joking about the concerns of vulnerable individuals" (Crewe 2009:13)
"Offi cers often discussed the 'mentality' of 'inmates' in highly generic terms, oblivious that they were objectifying the prisoners working silently around them" (Crewe 2009:13)
"Many offi cers failed to recognize that banter was often predicated on power differentials, and that such conditions could make it condescending and insulting—an aspect of domination" (Crewe 2009:14)
"although offi cers were committed to judging prisoners on the basis of present rather than past behaviour, the corollary of this ethos was that respect was to some degree withheld from prisoners who were diffi cult or abusive" (Crewe 2009:15)
"Both prisoners and offi cers saw respect as the outcome of reciprocal behaviour. However each believed that the onus was on the other to set the terms of interpersonal engagement" (Crewe 2009:15)
"The lack of solidarity was refl ected in the willingness of offi cers to extend their working hours in order to stem staff shortages, and in the frequency with which some uniformed staff 'went sick' to shirk work or obtain time off. Both were individualistic responses which undermined the potential for collective resistance and only exacerbated the staffi ng crisis for colleagues" (Crewe 2009:16)
"most decisions to extend contracted hours resulted from commitments to personal earnings rather than loyalty to the establishment or the Prison Service" (Crewe 2009:17)
"The main problems that offi cers reported related not to prisoners, but to senior managers, the Prison Service and the political context" (Crewe 2009:18)
"Offi cers also became increasingly reactive, reporting prisoner activity rather than supervising it" (Crewe 2009:19)
"When offi cers did come across disciplinary infractions, they used formal authority with inappropriate zeal, giving prisoners 'strikes' instead of using discretion" (Crewe 2009:19)
"while offi cers maintained relatively relaxed relations with prisoners, feelings of resignation led them to disengage from interpersonal work and resort to formal power to manage the wings. Retreat was a way of resisting managerial authority and offsetting feelings of powerlessness. In effect, offi cers embraced the role of the faceless turnkey that they felt the job had become, and did so in ways that undermined institutional aims" (Crewe 2009:20)
"acts where uniformed staff circumvented approved procedures to meet ends that they felt were otherwise unachievable" (Crewe 2009:21)
"Overcrowding and staff discontent placed considerable strain on Wellingborough's functions and relationships.29 Prisoners felt neglected, and were deeply frustrated at the lack of personal offi cer time. Despite Lewis's commitment to curtailing the regime as little as possible, wings could not always be staffed for evening exercise or association. The need to have offi cers in core positions also meant that important but expendable activities such as groupbased drug work, induction talks, and resettlement interviews were often cancelled" (Crewe 2009:21)
"Offi cers were proud of their ability to defuse prisoner frustrations and manage under diffi cult circumstances. Yet, in talking up the imminence of prisoner revolt while also quelling it, they highlighted a paradox. Dissent and disturbances were highly undesirable for offi cers, for anger would be directed against them or they would be its frontline victims. Yet in the absence of visible resistance—if the prison remained ostensibly calm, despite lower staffi ng—staff complaints were less likely to be taken seriously" (Crewe 2009:22)
viz staff winding up prisoners in Swaleside and Belmarsh. (note on p.22)
 
"Explanations on wing notice boards brusquely cited staff shortages, pointing an accusatory fi nger at management. When prisoners expressed annoyance, offi cers openly endorsed their feelings and vented their own frustrations. These actions testifi ed to the shared interests of those who worked the landings and those who lived on them. They also illustrated a sentiment shared by staff and prisoners that the world beyond the wings was indifferent to their concerns and stacked against their interests" (Crewe 2009:22)
"When food was substandard, or when handed-in items were slow to be passed on to prisoners, offi cers encouraged prisoners to lodge offi cial grievances. These were failures of service-delivery, which prisoners felt were not the responsibility of offi cers.31 Prisoners and wing staff recognized that, in many respects, neither had the capacity to solve the problems that most exercised the other" (Crewe 2009:23)
"managerial expectations meant that, while his fi nancial and operational discretion contracted, the pressure on him to deliver was heightened. The Prison Service was also 'increasingly demanding of particular ways of doing things', requiring that offending behaviour programmes were homogenous and accredited, and imposing orders and instructions from above on all manner of policies and practices" (Crewe 2009:24)
"power operated through personnel at all levels. For both governors and offi cers," (Crewe 2009:24)
"as much as power was exercised, it often felt 'elsewhere' and was never truly in their possession" (Crewe 2009:25)
"Lewis's declaration of powerlessness resonated in striking ways with prisoners' complaints about the elusiveness and anonymity of penal power, as coming chapters will show. It illustrated the way that, as for offi cers, managerialism could feel harsh and oppressive to those who were its institutional representatives" (Crewe 2009:25)
"Such pleas for empathy indicated the possibility of understanding between prisoners and their custodians. But the supplication of" (Crewe 2009:25)
"governors to prisoners was born of weakness, not the search for normative consensus as such. At the same time, it pointed to an alliance of interests within the institution: not divisions between different strata in the prison, but a line of division between the institution and the world above it." (Crewe 2009:26)
"Despite their frustrations and reservations, then, governors were highly compliant in the face of managerial power" (Crewe 2009:26)
"As suggested here, by running the prison 'effectively' (i.e. keeping within the budget, meeting targets, maintaining the regime), and fulfi lling a particular vision of institutional success, governors could perpetuate problems that edged beneath the managerialist radar, and could foment frustrations that would return to haunt them" (Crewe 2009:27)
"The distribution of power in Wellingborough made it possible for governors to suppress staff discontent, or push it into forms (such as staff sickness) that remained 'managerial' rather than systemic problems" (Crewe 2009:27)
"despite their enormous capacity to determine the quality of prison life for prisoners, uniformed staff did not perceive themselves to be powerful fi gures in institutional life. As a group, they were demoralized and fragmented. Managerial reforms had winched power to higher levels of the organization, eroding their collective infl uence. Many offi cers felt un-trusted, out of touch with institutional aims, and alienated from organizational decision-making. Cynicism about management motives and methods was widespread. Resentment was partly based on a feeling that managers cared more about prisoner wellbeing than staff concerns, and were fi xated on (what were considered) abstract and meaningless 'targets' while indifferent to the nature of the 'real work' that took place on the landings" (Crewe 2009:28)
"staff expressed their discontent by disengaging from interpersonal work or going sick" (Crewe 2009:28)
"governors felt little more autonomous and barely more in control of the institutional agenda" (Crewe 2009:28)
"governors and offi cers felt equally disempowered by the absence of visible discontent among prisoners. These pervasive feelings of powerlessness were intensifi ed by the knowledge that, by coping in diffi cult circumstances, one's problems were more likely to be perpetuated than resolved" (Crewe 2009:29)
"Uniformed staff expressed as much hostility and cynicism about governors as they did about prisoners (see Liebling 2004), with whom they shared space and developed tacit alliances through a shared perception of managerial neglect" (Crewe 2009:29)
"Centralized control had been tightened in part because of the moral defi ciencies and abuses that a less fi rmly managed system had allowed in previous decades. Senior managers justifi ed increased scrutiny and accountability by arguing that imprisonment, more than other domains, necessitated rather autocratic management, not so much of prisoners but staff. Inevitably though, the layers of audit that this view produces can imply a lack of faith in the expertise of professionals, who often felt restricted, controlled, and disempowered even while they recognized the benefi ts of oversight" (Crewe 2009:30)},

However, alongside accounts that emphasize such consequences are alternative narratives, in which some prisoners claim that carceral confinement has been a positive intervention in their life. Drawing on Scott’s idea of the reinventive institution, this article explores these narratives, which—contra Goffman—involve a voluntaristic commitment to the prison, active engagement in the process of identity reconstruction, normative alignment with institutional values and the role of lateral regulation in shaping the prisoner’s new self. Our analysis emphasizes the impact of the prison as an institutional form, and the ways that, in interaction with particular biographical experiences, it produces narratives of reinvention which imply an inversion of its normal destructive processes. Our argument is not a defence of imprisonment, but an attempt to theorize a narrative claim that, although expressed by a minority of prisoners, merits proper analysis.},

"an argument for viewing the prison not as a standalone institution encroaching on lives from 'outside' normal social space, as it were, but one that, to use Wacquant's (2002: 388) words, 'is woven deep into the fabric and lifecourse of the lower classes across generations'" (Crewe et al 2019:1362480619841901)
"This argument, that sometimes imprisonment appears to have positive function, is dotted around the literature, almost always with the same discomfort that is expressed in Wacquant's own qualifier ('counterintuitively and within limits'). We would be surprised if anyone who has done even a small amount of empirical prison research has not heard some prisoners—albeit a minority—say that prison has 'saved them', been a progressive 'turning point' in their life, or words to that effect" (Crewe et al 2019:1362480619841901)

	abstract = {Prison scholarship has tended to focus on the pains and frustrations that result from the use and over-use of penal power. Yet the absence of such power and the subjective benefits of its grip are also worthy of attention. This article begins by drawing on recent literature and research findings to develop the concept of ‘tightness’ beyond its initial formulation. Drawing primarily on data from a study of men convicted of sex offences, it goes on to explain that, in some circumstances, the reach and hold of penal power are not experienced as oppressive and undesirable, and, indeed, may be welcomed. Conversely, institutional inattention and an absence of grip may be experienced as painful. Prisons, then, can be ‘loose’ or ‘lax’ as well as ‘tight’. The article then discusses the different ways in which prisons exercise grip, and, in doing so, recognise or misrecognise the subjectivity of the individual prisoner. It concludes by identifying the connections between this ‘ground-up’ analysis of the relative legitimacy of different forms of penal intervention and recent discussions in penal theory about the proper role of the state in communicating censure and promoting personal repentance and change.},

"lford's primary argument is that The Bentham's Panopticon was never truly instantiated, and many prisons are characterised more by coercion and neglect than by the modes of classification and disciplinary training that Foucault elaborate" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928116)

"The difficulty for prisoners of having to become self-regulating agents has been identified in a number of studies, particularly those conducted in open prisons, typically holding prisoners deemed to be low-risk or nearing release, and who are granted glimpses or gulps of freedom (Pennington, 2015; Pettersson, 2017; Shammas, 2014)" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928117)

"a distinctive quality of these modes of power is that they are subjectifying. Neither straightforwardly coercive nor legitimate (see Garland, 1997), in their 'ideal' form - that is, when they 'work' - they produce subject positions that are adopted by some prisoners without any sense of having been externally imposed, and without cynicism" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928119)
"'tightness' communicates a form of grip whose closeness and consistency, and ability to seamlessly stitch the individual into its own project, is precisely what makes it so pernicious." (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928119)
"These conceptualisations of tightness represent the experience of soft power when it operates effectively, according to its own terms and objectives. In such situations, prisoners are risk assessed, characterised on file, and monitored in ways that turn them into self-regulating, risk-reducing, penal subjects, whose progression through the penal system is expedited by a particular mode of active and enthusiastic engagement, whether or not it is authentic" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928120)
"These questions were based on an initial assumption that prisoners were gripped by new forms of penal power, and that they resented this grip: it was only as fieldwork progressed that the more complex picture, as depicted in this article, became apparent" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928121)
"Prisoners convicted of sex offences in England \& Wales may have some distinctive tendencies. They may be more inclined than other prisoners to draw on 'censorious' forms of critique (see Mathiesen, 1965), and to consider themselves in need of behavioural and cognitive intervention (Ievins, 2017), for example" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928121)
"our analysis is consistent with the experiences of a broader range of prisoners, especially those serving the kinds of indeterminate sentences for which ideas of tightness and 'soft power' are most germane. There are therefore good grounds for believing that the empirical observations in this article are applicable well beyond the primary population on which the analysis is based" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928121)

"Russell's frustration was not that he was being asked to address his offending behaviour - 'I freely admit I need to be in jail and I needed the intervention. I understand that' - but that his inability to do so served to penalise him" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928122)
"A number of official reports corroborate this picture of systemic shortcomings in the delivery of offender management (see, for example, HM Inspectorates of Probation and Prisons, 2013; HMI Prisons, 2019; HMI Probation, 2019; see also Millings et al., 2019a).These include missing, poor-quality and overdue sentence plans, insufficient face-to-face contact between prisoners and offender supervisors, poor comprehension among prisoners of 'what they had to do to achieve the objectives set for them' (HM Inspectorates of Probation and Prisons, 2013, p. 28), the delivery of interventions not in accordance with sentence plan objectives, 'no alternative offence-focussed work [...] for prisoners deemed too low risk for accredited programmes for sex offenders' (HMI Prisons, 2019, p. 42), and a lack of access to accredited courses" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928123)
"resources made available to prisons for the purposes of offender management have simply not matched the requirements of the model. Additional problems relate to staff recruitment and training, inadequate communication and cooperation between offender management units within prisons and probation staff in the community, and long delays - caused primarily by a lack of headroom in the prison estate - in the transfer of prisoners to establishments where they can undertake mandated courses" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928123)

"Joel's sympathy with probation staff is of note, because it again points to an absence of normative opposition to the basic task of a set of practitioners whose primary objective (within the current context in England and Wales) is to manage risk" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928125)

"Prisoners who express such concerns want help with much more than accommodation, employment and other components of resettlement. They seek the kind of institutional attention to the self that, in other circumstances, produces some of the contemporary pains of imprisonment" (Crewe, Ievins 2020:1462474520928128)

	abstract = {This article argues that imprisonment creates time that does not matter. It is based on longitudinal interviews conducted with 35 men and women sentenced to typical prison sentences in England. It argues that some responded to this situation by trying to treat the institution as a space of temporary removal and then return to their unblemished lives after release. Others tried to use the prison as a space for reinvention, but it was too disconnected from their biographies for this change to endure. The article then calls for a new understanding of the prison as an institution. The prison is a space of non-life, and as such it can only be understood in the context of that which surrounds it.},
