<meta name="citation_title" content="Moral messages, ethical responses: Punishment and self-governance among men serving life sentences for murder">
<meta name="citation_abstract" content="This PhD uses theoretical and conceptual resources from the anthropology of morality and ethics to explore moral communication in the contemporary life sentence, as seen through the ethical lives of men serving life sentences for murder.
Empirically, it describes three things. First, moral communication *about murder*: what a conviction for this crime and the experience of imprisonment for life ‘said’ to prisoners about who they were and whom they ought to become. Second, moral communication *within a life course*: how people with different pre-prison experiences reacted to the rupture in identity imposed by the sanction. Third, moral communication *through the language of risk*: an unclear (though dominant) medium which imposed demands some lifers found a comfortable ‘fit’, but others did not.
These descriptions draw on interview and documentary data relating to forty-eight individuals: thirty in a long-term category-B prison, and eighteen in a category-D or ‘open’ prison focused on resettlement. All serving mandatory life sentences for murder, they were otherwise a heterogeneous group: convicted in diverse circumstances, aged from their teens to their seventies, and sentenced between 1983 and 2017. Their minimum terms ranged in length from less than ten to thirty years, and they had served between 7% and 250% of these minimums. Both in their backgrounds and in their custodial experiences, then, they formed a broad and diverse sample, affording a wide range of perspectives on the theoretical and substantive questions addressed by the research.
The PhD adds theoretical depth and empirical detail to a growing literature on experiences of long-term and life imprisonment. It also comments on some implications of this empirical material for how retributive penal theorists have understood the *aims* of punishment—in particular, whether long-term imprisonment succeeds in communicating to prisoners what is *wrong* (as opposed to merely *harmful*) about taking life. It argues, overall, that the mandatory life sentence as currently delivered is a morally incoherent sanction. On the one hand, it is too individualised to convey clear moral norms or to show meaningful solidarity with those harmed and wronged by murders. On the other, it is not individualised enough to communicate effectively with murderers about the ethical responses that their actions might warrant.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Aging Prisoners’ Concerns toward Dying in Prison;,citation_abstract=Prison populations are experiencing rapid increases and many more offenders are dying in prison. This study investigated key variables associated with death anxiety among a group of aging prisoners. For this research, 102 respondents residing in a maximum security prison with a mean age of 59 completed Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale. A regression analysis showed that age, inmate social supports, and a number of health related variables were important predictors of death fear. The findings revealed that fear of death is slightly higher among older prisoners than for similar age groups in the community. Qualitative information based on personal narratives found that some inmates see death as an escape, while others expressed fears of dying in prison or the stigma associated with imprisonment.;,citation_author=Ronald H.

However, it is not clear how this might apply to forensic mental health services, which offer mental health care to men and women who have offended when mentally unwell. In this article, we explore how discussion of the index offense fits into recovery paradigms and how reflection on offender identity relates to recovery.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is there a murderer here? The language of agency and violence in homicide perpetrators;,citation_abstract=This is a provocative collection exploring the different types of violence and how they relate to one another, examined through the integration of several disciplines, including forensic psychotherapy, psychiatry, sociology, psychosocial studies and political science. By examining the ’violent states’ of mind behind specific forms of violence and the social and societal contexts in which an individual act of human violence takes place, the contributors reveal the dynamic forces and reasoning behind specific forms of violence including structural violence, and conceptualise the societal structures themselves as ’violent states’.Other research often stops short at examining the causes and risk factors for violence, without considering the opposite states that may not only mitigate, but allow for a different unfolding of individual and societal evolution. As a potential antidote to violence, the authors prescribe an understanding of these ’creative states’ with their psychological origins, and their importance in human behaviour and meaning-seeking. Making a call to move beyond merely mitigating violence to the opposite direction of fostering creative potential, this book is foundational in its capacity to cultivate social consciousness and effect positive change in areas of governance, policy-making, and collective responsibility.Volume 2: Human Violence and Creative Humanity explores violent states of mind, behavioural or subjective, interpersonal violence (including self-injury) and the fine distinctions between violent and creative states of mind.;,citation_author=Gwen Adshead;,citation_author=Zoë A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Paying the Price: The Pressing Need for Quality, Cost, and Outcomes Data to Improve Correctional Health Care for Older Prisoners;,citation_abstract=Despite a recent decline in the U.S. prison population, the older prisoner population is growing rapidly. U.S. prisons are constitutionally required to provide health care to prisoners. As the population ages, healthcare costs rise, states are forced to cut spending, and many correctional agencies struggle to meet this legal standard of care. Failure to meet the healthcare needs of older prisoners, who now account for nearly 10% of the prison population, can cause avoidable suffering in a medically vulnerable population and violation of the constitutional mandate for timely access to an appropriate level of care while incarcerated. Older prisoners who cannot access adequate health care in prison also affect community healthcare systems because more than 95% of prisoners are eventually released, many to urban communities where healthcare disparities are common and acute healthcare resources are overused. A lack of uniform quality and cost data has significantly hampered innovations in policy and practice to improve value in correctional health care (achieving desired health outcomes at sustainable costs). With their unique knowledge of complex chronic disease management, experts in geriatrics are positioned to help address the aging crisis in correctional health care. This article delineates the basic health, cost, and outcomes data that geriatricians and gerontologists need to respond to this crisis, identifies gaps in the available data, and anticipates barriers to data collection that, if addressed, could enable clinicians and policy-makers to evaluate and improve the value of geriatric prison health care.;,citation_author=Cyrus Ahalt;,citation_author=Robert L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Populism, Conservatism and the Politics of Parole in England and Wales;,citation_abstract=Reform of the parole system has emerged as the cause célèbre of a resurgent law and order politics. Successive governments have seized upon the symbolic power of parole to demonstrate “toughness” with respect to violent and sexual offending, to express solidarity with the victims of crime and reaffirm a populist credo that purportedly stands in opposition to an unaccountable and out of touch penal elite. Published in March 2022, the Ministry of Justice Root and Branch Review of the Parole System represents a continuation of this well-rehearsed political strategy, but arguably goes further than ever before in its willingness to dispense with established norms, rules and practices. This article surveys the contemporary politics of parole in England and Wales and reflects upon what these developments reveal about the shifting contours of a creeping authoritarian conservatism premised upon nostalgia, nationalism and the projection of a strong, centralised state.;,citation_author=Harry Annison;,citation_author=Thomas Guiney;,citation_publication_date=2022-07;,citation_cover_date=2022-07;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/1467-923X.13170;,citation_issn=0032-3179, 1467-923X;,citation_volume=93;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Political Quarterly;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Life after life imprisonment;,citation_abstract=This book explores one of the most contentious and sensitive topics in criminal justice: the release and resettlement of life-sentenced offenders. The book provides an analysis of the post-prison experiences of 138 discretionary life-sentenced offenders, all of whom were released from prison across England and Wales during the mid-1990s. Using accessible data the book examines key legal developments within the criminal justice system for discretionary life-sentenced offenders, explores the frontline experiences of criminal justice practitioners charged with the responsibility of supervising life-sentenced offenders, and analyses the “stories” or life narratives of a group of individuals who have committed some of the most serious crimes. The book examines the process of recall for life-sentenced prisoners and explores key factors associated with failure in the community. The book offers an insight into how societies respond to serious crimes and identifies important elements of successful reintegration for released life-sentenced offenders.;,citation_author=Catherine Appleton;,citation_publication_date=2010-07;,citation_cover_date=2010-07;,citation_year=2010;,citation_doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199582716.001.0001;,citation_isbn=978-0-19-958271-6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Clarendon studies in criminology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=At Risk of Rights: Rehabilitation, Sentence Management and the Structural Violence of Prison;,citation_abstract=This article explores governing through rights in a penal context by analyzing a recent case before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (the “Court” or “Supreme Court”), Brown v The Parole Board for Scotland et&nbsp;al. (UKSC 2017). The case involved a prisoner whose stay in prison was extended by several years beyond what the trial court ordered because he was unable to access offender behavior courses due to staffing shortages and waiting lists. In rejecting this as an arbitrary detention (in violation of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights), the Supreme Court focused on the prisoner’s behavior as a justification for non-release. This article traces how the Court applied concepts of rehabilitation and sentence progression to shift focus from the state’s compliance with its rights duties to the prisoner’s deservingness of rights protection. Using frameworks of governmentality and structural violence, I explore how administrative processes, such as sentence management and rights litigation, facilitate and constitute prison violence. Specifically, rehabilitation provided the means of constructing the petitioner as a disobedient and undeserving subject, while simultaneously valorizing the penal authorities’ enlightened oversight of his sentence. Through such moves, the Court and, by extension, legal institutions, can inflict violence in three ways: first, by legitimating the extension of confinement using tools aimed at limiting detention; second, by imposing material and psychic burdens in the pursuit of legal claims, creating both hope and the basis of destroying it; and third, by obscuring and denying the disordered and inherently violent nature of the experience of imprisonment. The article seeks to expose how bureaucratic logics (like balancing tests), spaces (like appeal courts), and material practices (as in the temporal organization of “background facts” in legal judgments) are part of prison and the violence which characterizes the prison experience.;,citation_author=Sarah Armstrong;,citation_publication_date=2020-03;,citation_cover_date=2020-03;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10612-020-09503-7;,citation_issn=1205-8629, 1572-9877;,citation_volume=28;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Critical Criminology;">

It relates data from the measuring the quality of prison life (MQPL) survey carried out in all prisons in England and Wales to official data on proven reoffending from the Ministry of Justice. The sample contains data from 224 prison surveys conducted between 2009 and 2013 (a total of 24,508 prisoners completed the survey). Results indicate that several of the MQPL dimensions were found to be related to rates of proven reoffending for each prison. As the MQPL survey measures the moral, relational and organizational quality of prison life for prisoners, overall these findings suggest that higher moral quality of life, or higher interior legitimacy, supports better outcomes for prisoners on release. This is consistent with theoretical expectations about the links between legitimacy, engagement in prison programs, well-being, and compliance with the law.;,citation_author=Katherine M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“A sense of purpose”: Older prisoners’ experiences of successful ageing behind bars;,citation_abstract=There is growing interest in ageing offenders and their lives in prison. However, this subject is often studied from a deprivation perspective, focusing on issues such as lack of medical care and proper environmental conditions. This article highlights experiences of wellbeing while ageing in confinement, using the conceptual framework of successful ageing. An interpretive phenomenological analysis perspective was used to analyse the narratives of 18 older prisoners. The narratives revealed four themes: “Like all other older men”: comparing ageing in prison with ageing within the community; “Better than what I have outside”: prison as an escape from a life of loneliness, poverty and delinquency; “Here I get some respect”: the older prisoner as a mentor; and “I feel accomplished”: experiences of growth and self-discovery as a means for successful ageing in prison. The findings suggest that ageing in prison may not be perceived as a single, unified process, but as a personal and individual phenomenon, and that old age may facilitate positive changes in the lives of ageing offenders in prison.;,citation_author=Hila Avieli;,citation_publication_date=2021-02;,citation_cover_date=2021-02;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/1477370821995142;,citation_issn=1477-3708, 1741-2609;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=European Journal of Criminology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wasted Lives: Aging as an Incentive for Reconstruction of Desistance Intentions Among Older Adults in Prison;,citation_abstract=There is growing scholarly interest in older adults involved in crime and their lives in prison. However, the specific group of older adults who persistently offend (OAPO) and their desistance intentions has received little attention. The present study aims to explore the lived experiences of OAPO who intend to desist from crime. Seventeen OAPO were interviewed, and an interpretive phenomenological analysis approach was used to analyze the narratives they presented. Participants’ interviews revealed four superordinate themes: (1) insight and change in the lives of OAPO; (2) a series of losses lead to disillusionment with a life of crime; (3) desistance as the only alternative; and (4) fear of death in prison as a catalyst for desistance. The findings suggest that desistance intention among older adults in prison is an individualized process deeply affected by age-related motivations and dynamics.;,citation_author=Hila Avieli;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1177/0093854820937325;,citation_issn=0093-8548;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminal Justice and Behavior;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

This article investigates the relationships between older prisoners’ health, their experiences of the prison environment and health services, and their levels of psychological distress. One hundred and seventy-three older prisoners (aged 50 years and older) from eight Australian prisons were interviewed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, with additional information collected from prisoner interviews and correctional health files. Distress scores were significantly associated with measures of physical health, functional independence, and health care utilization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Remorse and Criminal Justice;,citation_abstract=A defendant’s failure to show remorse is one of the most powerful factors in criminal sentencing, including capital sentencing. Yet there is currently no evidence that remorse can be accurately evaluated in a courtroom. Conversely there is evidence that race and other impermissible factors create hurdles to evaluating remorse. There is thus an urgent need for studies about whether and how remorse can be accurately evaluated. Moreover, there is little evidence that remorse is correlated with future law-abiding behavior or other legitimate penal purposes, and, in fact, there is evidence that remorse is often conflated with shame, which is correlated with increased future criminality. More accurate information on the nature and evaluation of remorse can be used to reform the criminal justice system.;,citation_author=Susan A.

To a Friend in England;,citation_abstract=The Panopticon project for a model prison obsessed the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham for almost 20 years. In the end, the project came to nothing; the Panopticon was never built. But it is precisely this that makes the Panopticon project the best exemplification of Bentham’s own theory of fictions, according to which non-existent fictitious entities can have all too real effects. There is probably no building that has stirred more philosophical controversy than Bentham’s Panopticon. The Panopticon is not merely, as Foucault thought, “a cruel, ingenious cage”, in which subjects collaborate in their own subjection, but much more—constructing the Panopticon produces not only a prison, but also a god within it. The Panopticon is a machine which on assembly is already inhabited by a ghost. It is through the Panopticon and the closely related theory of fictions that Bentham has made his greatest impact on modern thought; above all, on the theory of power. The Panopticon writings are frequently cited, rarely read. This edition contains the complete “Panopticon Letters”, together with selections from “Panopticon Postscript I” and “Fragment on Ontology”, Bentham’s fullest account of fictions. A comprehensive introduction by Miran Bozovic explores the place of Panopticon in contemporary theoretical debate.;,citation_author=Jeremy Bentham;,citation_publication_date=2011-01;,citation_cover_date=2011-01;,citation_year=2011;,citation_isbn=978-1-84467-666-8;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_inbook_title=The Panopticon Writings;">

This precipitous growth is motivated by the timely alignment of theory, data, and method that characterized the opening of the twenty-first century. Despite the growth of the field, fundamental questions remain. This chapter provides a focused review of key twenty-first-century theoretical and methodological developments on desistance as well as a pointed discussion of critical issues. After outlining the current definitions and longitudinal trends of desistance, we discuss contemporary theories and the studies that inform these theories. We use an organizational schema situating theories in terms of the primacy with which they place structural opportunities or subjective motivations in their explanations of the transition away from offending. We conclude by presenting avenues for advancing research in the areas of definitions, theoretical testing, and bridging the research-policy divide.;,citation_author=Bianca E.

However, there has been much less empirical research exploring the experiences and perspectives of the prison environment within which treatment takes place. This is important, particularly for sexual offenders, as they often face multiple stigmas in prison. This study used a mixed-methods approach to explore the experiences of prisoners and staff at a therapeutically orientated sexual offenders’ prison to understand whether the prison environment was conducive to rehabilitation. The quantitative strand of the research sampled prisoners (n = 112) and staff (n = 48) from a therapeutically orientated sex offenders prison. This strand highlighted that both prisoners and staff had positive attitudes toward offenders and high beliefs that offenders could change. Importantly, the climate was rated positively and, in particular, participants had very high ratings of “experienced safety.” The qualitative strand of the research consisted of semistructured interviews with prisoners (n = 15) and a range of prison staff (n = 16). The qualitative analysis revealed positive prisoner views toward staff relationships, with most participants articulating that the prison and its staff had contributed to positive change in prisoners. Crucially, the environment was perceived as safe and allowed prisoners “headspace” to work through problems and contemplate change.;,citation_author=Nicholas Blagden;,citation_author=Belinda Winder;,citation_author=Charlie Hames;,citation_publication_date=2016-03;,citation_cover_date=2016-03;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/0306624x14553227;,citation_issn=0306-624X, 1552-6933;,citation_volume=60;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Desistance, social bonds, and human agency: A theoretical exploration;,citation_abstract=The I, the I is what is deeply mysterious.(Wittgenstein, 1915; quoted in Sluga, 1996: 321)It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.(Kierkegaard, 1843; quoted in Wollheim, 1984: 1)Criminals are ipso facto beyond the moral community.(Waddington, 2003: 395)The SCoPiC Network aims to understand more fully both individuals’ pathways into and out of crime, and the social contexts within which those pathways develop. Historically, however, there has been an interesting contrast between analyses of the onset and early development of criminal careers, and analyses of desistance from crime. The former have been predominantly individually and psychologically focused, and only recently has a more socially contextual approach been developed (see, for example, Wikström &amp;amp;amp;amp; Loeber, 2000). Desistance analyses, however, while markedly fewer in number than analyses of onset, have always tended to include at least some discussion of social context. For example, the well-known Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development has analyzed the effects of both locational change (Osborn, 1980) and marriage (Farrington &amp;amp; West, 1995) in relation to persistence in or desistance from crime in adulthood. In the early 1990s, one of the leading research studies on desistance (Sampson &amp;amp; Laub, 1993) also explicitly adopted a “social bonds” theoretical approach, arguing that “the stronger the adult ties to work and family, the less crime and deviance among [former] delinquents” (Laub &amp;amp; Sampson, 2003: 6; see further below).;,citation_author=Anthony Bottoms;,citation_editor=Per-Olof H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Freedom of Action, Freedom of Choice, and Desistance from Crime: Pitfalls and Opportunities in the Study of Human Agency;,citation_abstract=PurposeIn a recent issue of JDLCC, readers were presented with two opposing views of human agency and its value to life-course criminology. Paternoster (J Dev Life Course Criminol 3(4):350–372, 2017) proposes that agency be embraced as a key organizing concept in criminology, arguing that it is central to offender decision making and desistance from crime. In response, Cullen (J Dev Life Course Criminol 3(4):373–379, 2017) downplays the role of agency. He further argues that an emphasis on agency is antithetical to positivism, would undermine the search for the developmental and life-course causes of crime, and would legitimize punitive crime control policies. In this paper, I highlight the existence of a theoretical middle ground in the form of an alternative conceptualization of agency. In particular, I highlight the value of Albert Bandura’s sociocognitive approach to agency. Instead of asking whether agency plays a role in behavior, this approach leads us to ask the following: when, and under what conditions, is the meaningful exercise of agency likely to occur?ConclusionI argue that a sociocognitive approach largely avoids the potential pitfalls identified by Cullen and can readily be adapted to the contemporary study of desistance. It also draws attention to issues in need of further examination and can inspire new lines of desistance research.;,citation_author=Timothy Brezina;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1007/s40865-019-00111-w;,citation_issn=2199-465X;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Developmental and Life-Course Criminology;">

The types of subjects and time periods used varied widely, thus making a comparison of the findings, at times, difficult. The results suggested that imprisonment is not harmful to all individuals: Some persons deteriorated in response to confinement, other persons improved their functioning, and still others showed no appreciable change. A complex interaction of factors including individual difference variables, institutional orientation, degree of crowding, phase of sentence, and peer group affiliation seems to influence an individual’s response to confinement. The findings also have implications for current correctional controversies such as the &amp;amp;amp;quot;nothing works&amp;quot; issue and the relative value of determinate versus indeterminate sentencing procedures. Future research should further clarify the effects on prisoner adjustment of intrainstitutional variables such as crowding, solitary confinement, prison policy changes, and peer group affiliation. The various patterns of adaptation to confinement in relation to individual difference variables also should be explored.;,citation_author=Lee H. Bukstel;,citation_author=Peter R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The weaponisation of “trauma-informed” discourse in prison policy: An abolition feminist critique;,citation_abstract=Taking an abolition feminist standpoint, this article develops a critique of the absorption of the language of “trauma-informed practice” into gendered penal policy. We use Carol Bacchi’s methodology for post-structural policy analysis, which centres around the question, “what is the problem represented to be?”, and apply it to an Australian correctional policy document designed to inform practice in the Victorian women’s prison system: Strengthening Connections. We find that the policy constructs criminalised women’s trauma as an individual psychological pathology that causes “criminal offending” and makes them vulnerable to further harm. In effect, the prison is framed as both necessary for the protection of the community and for the protection of criminalised women themselves. We argue that these discursive distortions sanitise the structural violence of the prison and revalorise the carceral state under the guises of rehabilitation and therapy. Our contribution highlights broader implications and challenges for criminological research that engages attempts to “soften” carceral conditions without reckoning with their capacity to entrench gendered carceralism.;,citation_author=Bree Carlton;,citation_author=Emma K Russell;,citation_publication_date=2023-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1177/26326663231197960;,citation_issn=2632-6663, 2632-6663;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Incarceration;">

In terms of the prison experience, we argue that elderly men in prison often have enormous difficulties simply coping with the prison regime. In addition, most have certain painful pre-occupations, including a fear of dying in prison, the loss of familial contact, the loss of a “protector” role, the loss of a respectable (non-prisoner) identity and the loss of a coherent and satisfactory life narrative. In terms of release, we argue that elderly men in prison often experience significant release and resettlement fears. Many recognize that not only are they vulnerable to assault when released (this applies particularly to those convicted of sexual offences) they also have “nothing to go out to” and too little time left to “start over”.

First, it sets out the various factors that contribute to “depth” i.e. its core components. Second, it outlines the most frequent metaphors used to communicate depth, highlighting the ways in which these metaphors bring into focus a range of ways in which the basic fact of imprisonment – the deprivation of liberty, and the removal of the individual from the community – is experienced.

This article revisits the topic, suggesting that modern penal practices have created some new burdens and frustrations that differ from other pains in their causes, nature and effects. It notes that the pains of imprisonment can be divided up conceptually, and to some degree historically, into those deriving from the inherent features of incarceration, those resulting from deliberate abuses and derelictions of duty, and those that are consequences of systemic policies and institutional practices. Having described the latter in detail – focusing on the pains of indeterminacy, the pains of psychological assessment and the pains of self-government, the article explains the relevance of the concept of “tightness”, as well as “depth” and “weight”, to the contemporary prison experience.;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_publication_date=2011-12;,citation_cover_date=2011-12;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474511422172;,citation_issn=1462-4745, 1741-3095;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

This article aims to redress this pattern by comparing the problems of long-term confinement as experienced by male and female prisoners, and then detailing the most significant and distinctive problems reported by the latter. It begins by reporting data that illustrate that the women report an acutely more painful experience than their male counterparts. It then focuses on the issues that were of particular salience to the women: loss of contact with family members; power, autonomy and control; psychological well-being and mental health; and matters of trust, privacy and intimacy.

None the less, it is generally assumed that prisons that are “light” are preferable to those that are “heavy” – in part because of an assumption among many penologists that power, and its application, is dangerous and antagonistic. This article does not dispute that “heavy” prisons are undesirable. Its argument is that there can also be dangers if prisons are excessively light. Many of these dangers are linked to the under-use of power. The tone and quality of prison life depends on the combined effects of institutional weight with the “absence” or “presence” of staff power. Drawing on prisoners’ descriptions of their experiences in public and private sector prisons, and their assessments of important aspects of their quality of life, the article outlines what these concepts mean in practice.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The prison as a reinventive institution;,citation_abstract=There is plentiful evidence that imprisonment is painful, harmful and criminogenic. However, alongside accounts that emphasize such consequences are alternative narratives, in which some prisoners claim that carceral confinement has been a positive intervention in their life. Drawing on Scott’s idea of the reinventive institution, this article explores these narratives, which—contra Goffman—involve a voluntaristic commitment to the prison, active engagement in the process of identity reconstruction, normative alignment with institutional values and the role of lateral regulation in shaping the prisoner’s new self. Our analysis emphasizes the impact of the prison as an institutional form, and the ways that, in interaction with particular biographical experiences, it produces narratives of reinvention which imply an inversion of its normal destructive processes. Our argument is not a defence of imprisonment, but an attempt to theorize a narrative claim that, although expressed by a minority of prisoners, merits proper analysis.;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_author=Alice Ievins;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1177/1362480619841900;,citation_issn=1362-4806;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Theoretical Criminology;">

Drawing on a study of values, practices, and quality of life in five private-sector and two public-sector prisons in England and Wales, this article seeks to compare and explain three key domains of prison culture and quality: relationships between frontline staff and prisoners, levels of staff professionalism (or jailcraft), and prisoners’ experience of state authority. The study identifies some of the characteristic strengths and weaknesses of the public and private prison sectors, particularly in relation to staff professionalism and its impact on the prisoner experience. These findings have relevance beyond the sphere of prisons and punishment.;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_author=Alison Liebling;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_publication_date=2015-03;,citation_cover_date=2015-03;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/lsi.12093;,citation_issn=08976546;,citation_volume=40;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Law &amp;amp;amp; Social Inquiry;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Swimming with the Tide: Adapting to Long-Term Imprisonment;,citation_abstract=Given the increasing number of prisoners serving life sentences in England and Wales, and the increasing average length of these sentences, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to the experiences and effects of such sanctions. This article describes how prisoners serving very long sentences from an early age adapt over time to their circumstances. In particular, it focuses on the transition between the early and subsequent stages of such sentences, specifically, the ways that these prisoners adapt to the sentence, manage time, come to terms with their offense, shift their conception of control, make their sentence constructive, and find wider meaning in and from their predicament. Our argument is that most prisoners demonstrate a shift from a form of agency that is reactive to one that is productive, as they learn to “swim with”, rather than against, the tide of their situation.;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_author=Serena Wright;,citation_publication_date=2017-04;,citation_cover_date=2017-04;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1080/07418825.2016.1190394;,citation_issn=0741-8825;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=Justice Quarterly;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“Tightness”, recognition and penal power;,citation_abstract=Prison scholarship has tended to focus on the pains and frustrations that result from the use and over-use of penal power. Yet the absence of such power and the subjective benefits of its grip are also worthy of attention. This article begins by drawing on recent literature and research findings to develop the concept of “tightness” beyond its initial formulation. Drawing primarily on data from a study of men convicted of sex offences, it goes on to explain that, in some circumstances, the reach and hold of penal power are not experienced as oppressive and undesirable, and, indeed, may be welcomed. Conversely, institutional inattention and an absence of grip may be experienced as painful. Prisons, then, can be “loose” or “lax” as well as “tight”. The article then discusses the different ways in which prisons exercise grip, and, in doing so, recognise or misrecognise the subjectivity of the individual prisoner. It concludes by identifying the connections between this “ground-up” analysis of the relative legitimacy of different forms of penal intervention and recent discussions in penal theory about the proper role of the state in communicating censure and promoting personal repentance and change.;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_author=Alice Ievins;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474520928115;,citation_issn=1462-4745, 1741-3095;,citation_volume=23;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">

This study seeks to illuminate these issues by comparing the disciplinary behavior of 1,897 inmates sentenced to LWOP in the Florida Department of Corrections to that of 7,147 inmates serving sentences of 10 to 30 or more years. The sample is restricted to inmates admitted between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2002, sentenced to a prison term of 10 years or longer, who remained in prison on December 31, 2003, and classified to close custody. The data show that the likelihood and pattern of disciplinary infrac- tions and potentially violent rule infractions among LWOP inmates during 1998 to 2003 is broadly similar to that of other long-term inmates, supporting a conclusion that LWOP inmates act as a stabilizing rather than disruptive force in the prison environment.;,citation_author=Mark D.

We asked the following questions: does psychosis impair capacity for, or expression of, remorse for a homicide or other serious harm to others? Is failure to express remorse for an offence associated with recidivism? We conducted systematic reviews of empirical literature on remorse for serious violence while psychotic, and on relationships between remorse and reoffending regardless of mental state. No articles on remorse for homicide or other serious violence while psychotic were identified. There is weak evidence that lack of remorse is associated with reoffending generally, but nothing specific to psychosis. The literature is strong enough to support a case for research into valid measurement of remorse for offending, associations of such measures with recidivism, and whether a change in remorse can be effected – or matters. It is not strong enough to support reliance on perceptions of the presence or absence of remorse as a basis for judicial decisions.;,citation_author=Akshita Dandawate;,citation_author=Natasha Kalebic;,citation_author=Nicola Padfield;,citation_author=Jackie Craissati;,citation_author=Pamela J.

Participants reported a mean of 6.40 on the TDAS indicating a substantial degree of death anxiety when compared to community samples.

Yet there are times when we wish we (or others) weren’t such creatures of habit. When a doctor or bleary eyed legal official insists on following patently inadequate, routine proceedings in spite of significant clues calling for critical, renewed engagement on their part, they fall prey to what I have called the “compromising” aspect of habituation. The latter is concomitant with a degradation in the type of automaticity underlying the relevant habits: this degradation can be the result of a lack of aspiration, as shown by Annas, but it need not be. In a morally loaded, professional context, this degradation can also stem from what I refer to as a lack of “teleological plasticity”. The latter is not just a matter of adapting to changing circumstances, as is the case with a skill such a tennis (weather or type of play). It is also a matter of retaining a willingness to question the pertinence of the goals one associates with one’s professional practice (and its underlying habits).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is Homicide a Turning Point in the Life of Perpetrators? A Narrative Analysis of the Life Stories of Marginalized and Middle-Class Male Homicide Offenders in Metropolitan Buenos Aires, Argentina;,citation_abstract=This paper aims to analyze the relevance given to violent deaths and imprisonment by male homicide perpetrators in their biographical reconstructions. Drawing on narrative criminology, this study examines the offenders’ emic terms, rationalities, and stories. The analysis is based on seventy-three purposefully selected narrative-biographical interviews and field observations in prisons and homes of former convicts (2016-2020) in Metropolitan Buenos Aires, Argentina. The corpus was analyzed following an inductive thematic coding strategy using ATLAS.ti. Three central narratives about homicide and incarceration emerged: “opportunity,” “rock bottom,” and “disruptive.” For most, homicide was described as a biographical opportunity to rethink their lives, pursue new pathways, and “stabilize” a previously uncontrolled lifestyle. However, homicides perpetrated by respondents with higher socioeconomic status were disruptive events. Participants used stoic rationality—the positive appraisal of painful experiences—to structure their sense-making and stories of violence. This rationality permeated perpetrators’ presentations of themselves, their turning points and lived experiences, and the violence performed and suffered. This paper grapples with the widespread assumption that homicide is a radical change in the lives of offenders and questions the universal meaning of violent death. Performing violence is not only neutralized but is also seen as an expected and inaugural event in life stories, dependent on the worldviews of the social actors.;,citation_author=Martín Hernán Di Marco;,citation_publication_date=2022-10;,citation_cover_date=2022-10;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.18778/1733-8077.18.4.06;,citation_issn=1733-8077;,citation_volume=18;,citation_journal_title=Qualitative Sociology Review;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Why? How Perpetrators of Male-Male Homicide Explain the Crime;,citation_abstract=This paper identifies the explanatory narratives used by perpetrators of male-male homicide in Buenos Aires (Argentina) to make sense of this crime. Drawing upon narrative criminology and masculinities theories, this study enquires into the rationalisations of perpetrators, considering their emic terms, rationalities and stories. Fieldwork was conducted between 2016 and 2020, and a convenience sample strategy was employed for participant recruitment. The analysis is based upon seventy-three narrative-biographical interviews with offenders, and field observations in prisons and homes of former convicts. The corpus was analysed following an inductive thematic coding strategy using Atlas.Ti. Eight narratives were typified, considering how men talked about agency and change, and the explanatory locus of the stories: “rebel”, “affected”, “idiot”, “either him or me”, “repeating the story”, “gang”, “betrayed” and “victim”. These accounts revealed two paradoxes about violence perpetration storytelling and its discursive management: men can commit a homicide and present themselves as not responsible for it and, simultaneously, they use, reconfigure and negotiate expert theories and scientific labels to explain away, excuse and justify lethal violence. This study argues that accounts are not merely neutralisation strategies, but the rationalisations of the perpetrators’ experiences, and the foundation for how they relate to and inhabit penal institutions. This paper contributes to the understanding of how those explanations shape past and future actions, and how masculinities, biographical processes and violence performance are interconnected.;,citation_author=Martín Hernán Di Marco;,citation_publication_date=2023-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=1-2;,citation_doi=10.1177/08862605221081930;,citation_issn=0886-2605;,citation_volume=38;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Punishment, Communication, and Community;,citation_abstract=The question &amp;amp;amp;quot;What can justify criminal punishment ?&amp;quot; becomes especially insistent at times, like our own, of penal crisis, when serious doubts are raised not only about the justice or efficacy of particular modes of punishment, but about the very legitimacy of the whole penal system. Recent theorizing about punishment offers a variety of answers to that question-answers that try to make plausible sense of the idea that punishment is justified as being deserved for past crimes; answers that try to identify some beneficial consequences in terms of which punishment might be justified; as well as abolitionist answers telling us that we should seek to abolish, rather than to justify, criminal punishment. This book begins with a critical survey of recent trends in penal theory, but goes on to develop an original account (based on Duff’s earlier Trials and Punishments) of criminal punishment as a mode of moral communication, aimed at inducing repentance, reform, and reconciliation through reparation-an account that undercuts the traditional controversies between consequentialist and retributivist penal theories, and that shows how abolitionist concerns can properly be met by a system of communicative punishments. In developing this account, Duff articulates the &quot;liberal communitarian&quot; conception of political society (and of the role of the criminal law) on which it depends; he discusses the meaning and role of different modes of punishment, showing how they can constitute appropriate modes of moral communication between political community and its citizens; and he identifies the essential preconditions for the justice of punishment as thus conceived-preconditions whose non-satisfaction makes our own system of criminal punishment morally problematic. Punishment, Communication, and Community offers no easy answers, but provides a rich and ambitious ideal of what criminal punishment could be-an ideal of what criminal punishment cold be-and ideal that challenges existing penal theories as well as our existing penal theories as well as our existing penal practices.;,citation_author=Antony Duff;,citation_publication_date=2003;,citation_cover_date=2003;,citation_year=2003;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true\&amp;amp;scope=site\&amp;db=nlebk\&amp;db=nlabk\&amp;AN=690240;,citation_isbn=978-0-19-802643-3 978-0-19-510429-5 978-0-19-516666-8;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Women Lifers: Lives Before, Behind, and Beyond Bars;,citation_abstract=The number of women in United States prisons has increased dramatically since the 1980s, and has in proportion outpaced that of men’s incarceration. Despite these numbers, incarcerated women, and women lifers specifically, represent a relatively small percentage of the overall correctional and lifer populations. As such, women lifers are easy to overlook, discount, and diminish as such a small group. Many women lifers perceive themselves as a forgotten group; most often those whom we &amp;amp;amp;quot;lock up&amp;quot; and &quot;throw away the key.&quot; They feel excluded from prison programming within and from their own families outside. They feel stigmatized by staff and other women in prison. Aging fast, many have real fears about declining health and losing family members over lengthy stretches of time. However, women lifers are some of the most resilient and strongest women who survive life in prison with the support of each other and religious faith, often transforming themselves in the process of doing time. While most of the women had extensive histories of trauma, abuse, and mental health issues, few had prior experience as offenders. Despite the term &quot;lifer,&quot; many of these women will be released from prison after serving long sentences. Beyond this basic profile, there is much more to learn and share about the lives of women lifers. Focusing on women’s pathways into prison, the ways they cope with life behind bars, and their diverse reentry needs, Meredith Dye and Ronald Aday give voice to women lifers and place their experiences within the larger context of penal harm policies. The authors look at their physical and mental health, family connections, adjustment to prison, prison supports and activities, and experiences with abuse/trauma; while also looking at the growing public and policy concerns over mass incarceration in general. Women Lifers provides insight into the lives of incarcerated women before, during, and following a life sentence, especially the population of those serving life sentences. With the growing numbers of women lifers in the United States, the authors emphasize the importance for the public and policymakers to understand the unique circumstances that brought these women to prison, the policies that keep them there, and the major challenges they face in carving out a successful life in prison and beyond.;,citation_author=Meredith Huey Dye;,citation_author=Ronald H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How do parole board members in England and Wales construct decisions about whether to release perpetrators of intimate partner violence from prison?;,citation_abstract=Background Existing research explores Parole Board decision-making, but not specifically for perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV), a special case due to the gendered and secretive nature of IPV and the role of control in predicting reoffending. Aim To identify associations between case variables in England and Wales Parole Board decisions regarding perpetrators of IPV and explore how these variables help construct the decision. Methods Logistic regressions regarding decisions in a sample of all 137 male prisoners who had abused women and applied for release or progression to open conditions in England and Wales from April 2018 to September 2019, developed into latent class analyses. Thematic analyses of six interviews with Parole Board members about decision-making in IPV cases. Results Release decisions were strongly predicted by the recommendations of offender managers, offender supervisors and psychologists, mediated by the Parole Board’s confidence in their ability. Decisions were also significantly associated with custodial behaviour and attendance on courses, mediated by the Board’s confidence in the prisoner’s insight and honesty. Thematic analysis was both consistent with these findings and provided a context in which the associations could be understood. Conclusions The findings have implications for understanding the dynamics between professional decisions and the Parole Board’s decision; for the importance of offender managers demonstrating their expertise and ability to manage risk; for Parole Board members’ reflection and development; for academic research into IPV; and for those who have experienced IPV and are looking to understand parole decisions about their abuser.;,citation_author=Chris Dyke;,citation_author=Karen Schucan Bird;,citation_author=Carol Rivas;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1002/cbm.2183;,citation_issn=1471-2857;,citation_volume=30;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health;">

Focusing on the way men use cooking facilities on the prison’s wings, the article explores the way men make food for themselves and each other and thereby occupy prison space with unconventional (and conventional) gender practice. Using intersectional perspectives the article shows how practices of racialization, racism, conviviality and coercion are woven into the fabric of prison life. These quotidian experiences are juxtaposed against the question of how prisons and prisoner populations represent a spectrum of violence in which gender dynamics remain under-examined. By providing glimpses of men’s lives in an English prison to reveal aspects of the ways masculinities and ethnicities interact to shape a penal regime the authors offer some resources for, and perspective on, the theorization of punishment’s boundaries.;,citation_author=Rod Earle;,citation_author=Coretta Phillips;,citation_publication_date=2012-05;,citation_cover_date=2012-05;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1362480612441121;,citation_issn=1362-4806;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Theoretical Criminology;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Discursive Chains: How Prison Becomes Real and Chains Identity Movements For a Sex Offender;,citation_abstract=Detainees enact a “self” that is faced with the prejudices and stereotypes of the crime for which that detainee was convicted. Of all inmates, sex offenders face the greatest risk of receiving social condemnation alongside their prison sentence. This empirical study worked with 32 male sex offenders over 18 years old that were housed in the “protected” unit of the Due Palazzi. The following analysis explores how these men are required to manage their “self,” hetero-narrations, perception of everyday interactions in the protected unit, and conceptions about the rehabilitation path. Moreover, the detainees’ view on the prison’s strategic opportunities for promoting effective change in their condition and identity are also examined. Discourse analysis applied to an open answer questionnaire showed that, rather than facing the stigma assigned to them, the detainees tend to minimize the importance of storytelling and construct alternative biographies to share with other inmates. Managing narratives allows the sex offenders to distance themselves from the perceived threats of living with other detainees; however, it also prevents the re-signification of their offenses. As such, the rules of “secrecy” must be considered by both qualitative researchers who conduct studies in prisons and prison administrators who plan the housing and treatment of sex offenders.;,citation_author=Elena Faccio;,citation_author=Matteo Mazzucato;,citation_author=Antonio Iudici;,citation_publication_date=2020-03;,citation_cover_date=2020-03;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v9i2.1434;,citation_issn=2202-8005, 2202-7998;,citation_volume=9;,citation_journal_title=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PTSD and complex PTSD in sentenced male prisoners in the UK: Prevalence, trauma antecedents, and psychiatric comorbidities;,citation_abstract=BackgroundPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent within prison settings, yet is often unidentified and undertreated. Complex PTSD (CPTSD) has been recently formally recognised in the International Classification of Diseases 11th revision (ICD-11) diagnostic framework but has never been explored in prison settings. We aimed to establish the prevalence of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD in a UK prison sample using a validated instrument (the International Trauma Questionnaire). We also explored the associations of these two diagnoses with their traumatic antecedents and psychiatric comorbidities.MethodRandomly selected male, sentenced prisoners in a large medium-security prison in south London (N = 221) took part in a clinical interview which assessed PTSD, CPTSD, trauma histories, and comorbid disorders. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine differences between those with PTSD or CPTSD, and those without symptoms.ResultsA total of 7.7% (95% CI 4.5–12) of the male sentenced prisoners met diagnostic criteria for ICD-11 PTSD and 16.7% (95% CI 12.1–22.3) for CPTSD. A diagnosis of PTSD was associated with more recent traumatic exposure, comorbid generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and Cluster B personality disorder. A diagnosis of CPTSD was associated with complex trauma exposure antecedents (developmental, interpersonal, repeated, or multiple forms), and comorbid with anxiety, depression, substance misuse, psychosis, and ADHD.ConclusionsThis study confirms that CPTSD is a very common and comorbid condition in male prisoners. There is an urgent need to develop trauma-informed care in prisons.;,citation_author=Emma Facer-Irwin;,citation_author=Thanos Karatzias;,citation_author=Annie Bird;,citation_author=Nigel Blackwood;,citation_author=Deirdre MacManus;,citation_publication_date=2022-10;,citation_cover_date=2022-10;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=13;,citation_doi=10.1017/S0033291720004936;,citation_issn=0033-2917, 1469-8978;,citation_volume=52;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychological Medicine;,citation_publisher=Cambridge University Press;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Resistance and Adaptation to Criminal Identity: Using Secondary Analysis to Evaluate Classic Studies of Crime and Deviance;,citation_abstract=Qualitative data offer rich insights into the social world, whether alone or in tandem with statistical analysis. However, qualitative data are costly to collect and analyse. Moreover, it is a commonplace that only a portion of the data so labouriously collected is the subject of final analysis and publication. Secondary analysis is a well-established method in quantitative research and is raising its profile in application to qualitative data. It has a particular part to play when research is on sensitive topics and/or hard-to-reach populations, as in the example considered here. This article contributes to discussion of the potential and constraints of secondary analysis of qualitative data by reporting the outcome of the secondary analysis of a key study in the sociology of prison life, Cohen and Taylor’s research on the long-term imprisonment of men in maximum security. The article re-visits Cohen and Taylor’s original analysis and demonstrates support for an alternative, if complementary, conceptualisation, using archived data from the original study.

Since forensic psychiatry aims at reducing violence and recidivism, treatment of PTSD in this population is of great importance. Controlled studies to the feasibility and effectiveness of PTSD treatment within forensic populations are lacking. In five case studies, however, feasibility of EMDR is demonstrated in offenders with PTSD and comorbid disorders like psychosis or depression. The present case study aimed to expand this knowledge by describing the application of EMDR to a forensic psychiatric patient with a narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial and borderline features, and PTSD resulting from a murder he committed. Over the course of EMDR, PTSD symptoms (both established by clinical interview and self-report) decreased. Posttreatment, the patient did not meet the criteria for PTSD anymore.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Police practice in cases of sudden and unexpected child death in England and Wales: An investigative deficit?;,citation_abstract=Purpose The system in England and Wales involves a joint agency response to the sudden and unexpected death of a child (SUDC) and, for various reasons, the police contribution to that investigation is sometimes inadequate. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of the dilemmas which explain this inadequacy. Design/methodology/approach The arguments presented in the paper are made on the basis of empirically derived findings, drawing from original research based upon qualitative interviews with nine senior detectives working in the areas of child abuse or major crime, as well as focus groups of senior detectives, and a limited contribution from pathologists. Findings This paper explores whether there is an investigative deficit in respect of potential child homicide when compared to an adult domestic homicide, and it concludes that in some areas the most vulnerable people in society may be at risk because of issues such as inadequate training, inflexible force policies and under-resourced police investigation of child death. Practical implications It is possible to kill a child and leave few, if any, physical clues on the body. To determine if homicide is the cause of death, the overall police investigation therefore has to be of high quality to identify any clues that have been left by the perpetrator at the scene or in other ways. It is usual for Child Abuse Investigation Unit detectives to investigate SUDC but they are often trying to do so with little training and few resources. Cuts to police service budgets since 2010 have affected all elements of policing, including Major Crime Teams. As a result, these teams are more discerning about which cases they take on and there is evidence they are not taking on child death investigations even if there are suspicions of homicide. The findings reveal important implications for police investigative training and a clear and significant deficit in the investigative resources available to the lead investigator on a SUDC investigation which may or may not be a homicide, compared with the resources available to the senior investigating officer on a straightforward domestic homicide when the victim is an adult. If homicide is missed, then siblings or future siblings with that family may be left at risk of harm. The College of Policing suggested standards for SUDC investigation are sometimes not being adhered to in respect of training and resources. Originality/value The paper is informed by original qualitative research conducted in 2019. The findings are of value to police policy makers, the College of Policing, and police senior leadership teams.;,citation_author=John Fox;,citation_publication_date=2019-09;,citation_cover_date=2019-09;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1108/jcrpp-03-2019-0018;,citation_issn=2056-3841;,citation_volume=5;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society;,citation_abstract=The past 30 years have seen vast changes in our attitudes toward crime. More and more of us live in gated communities; prison populations have skyrocketed; and issues such as racial profiling, community policing, and &amp;amp;amp;quot;zero-tolerance&amp;quot; policies dominate the headlines. How is it that our response to crime and our sense of criminal justice has come to be so dramatically reconfigured? David Garland charts the changes in crime and criminal justice in America and Britain over the past twenty-five years, showing how they have been shaped by two underlying social forces: the distinctive social organization of late modernity and the neoconservative politics that came to dominate the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s.Garland explains how the new policies of crime and punishment, welfare and security—and the changing class, race, and gender relations that underpin them—are linked to the fundamental problems of governing contemporary societies, as states, corporations, and private citizens grapple with a volatile economy and a culture that combines expanded personal freedom with relaxed social controls. It is the risky, unfixed character of modern life that underlies our accelerating concern with control and crime control in particular. It is not just crime that has changed; society has changed as well, and this transformation has reshaped criminological thought, public policy, and the cultural meaning of crime and criminals.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Long sentenced women prisoners: Rights, risks and rehabilitation;,citation_abstract=This paper re-examines critically the role of rehabilitative interventions for a seriously neglected group of prisoners: women serving long sentences. Drawing on empirical research conducted in a democratic therapeutic community in a women’s prison in the south of England, it considers how far established criticisms identify insuperable difficulties that exacerbate existing harms and inequalities. It argues that evidence can be adduced to support rehabilitative interventions that are not predominantly concerned with the reduction of criminal risk but which provide tangible benefits to the personal wellbeing of women in prison and may increase their prospects of integration post release. It explores how such rehabilitative policies and practices could be supported and protected from attrition by penal power, by embedding them within a doctrine of human rights. By challenging and replacing prevalent assumptions and justifications that uphold existing power relations in prisons, we argue that a specific duty of care, owed by the prison service to women serving long sentences, can protect, support and re-imagine their right to rehabilitative opportunities.;,citation_author=Elaine Genders;,citation_author=Elaine Player;,citation_publication_date=2022-01;,citation_cover_date=2022-01;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474520933097;,citation_issn=1462-4745;,citation_volume=24;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rehabilitation, risk management and prisoners’ rights;,citation_abstract=The expansion of prison treatment programmes for personality disordered offenders as part of the “Rehabilitation Revolution” in England and Wales raises significant questions about the ways in which inherent concepts of risks, rights and rehabilitation are selectively perceived and employed. Current policy supports rehabilitative opportunities that address the risks offenders pose to the public, yet remains inattentive to the risk of harm that rehabilitative programmes can pose to offenders. Examination of the risk of personal harm intrinsic to one rehabilitative intervention for personality disordered prisoners – the democratic therapeutic community – illustrates how the selective acknowledgement of human rights in contemporary penal policy, whereby prisoners’ rights are routinely tied to a status of less eligibility, has important consequences that both undermine the integrity of programme delivery and seriously jeopardize the positive duties that are inherent in the duty of care owed to prisoners by the State.;,citation_author=Elaine Genders;,citation_author=Elaine Player;,citation_publication_date=2014-09;,citation_cover_date=2014-09;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1748895813502500;,citation_issn=1748-8958, 1748-8966;,citation_volume=14;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminology &amp;amp;amp; Criminal Justice;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Post-traumatic stress disorder caused in mentally disordered offenders by the committing of a serious violent or sexual offence;,citation_abstract=The aim of the study was to measure in a sample of mentally disordered offenders the frequency of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms related to the committing of an offence and to consider what factors might be contributory to the onset and maintenance of these symptoms. The study was the first to investigate the incidence of PTSD in a primarily mentally ill population. A sample of 37 mentally disordered offenders was assessed for PTSD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) and the Impact of Events Scale (IES; Horowitz, Wilner and Alvarez, 1979). Of this sample, 33% met diagnostic criteria for PTSD and 54% had significant PTSD symptomatology as indexed by the IES. The IES scores were greater in those who had committed violent offences than in those who had committed sexual offences, and in those who had an affective diagnosis. Frequency of PTSD symptoms was greater in those offenders who now felt regret for their actions. The high frequency of PTSD symptoms in this population may serve as a significant stressor and may exacerbate co-morbid psychiatric illness and contribute to poor treatment response and relapse. Many mental illnesses are exacerbated by stress and the presence of untreated PTSD symptoms may serve to prevent treatment gains for the primary mental disorder. If risk of future dangerous-ness is associated with unstable mental state, as is often the case in a mentally disordered population, then the development of PTSD post-offence may serve to prolong or increase risk of harm to both self and others.;,citation_author=Nicola S.

We refigure the concept to identify narratives that facilitate and legitimize control of criminalized populations. Drawing on 109 California parole hearings, we show how parole commissioners use logics of deserving and dangerous masculinity to assert a boundary between men deemed ready for social reintegration and men relegated to captivity. Commissioners articulate criminalized masculinity along three dimensions: relationship to self; relationship to male peers; and relationship to subordinate others like women and children. These gender logics are materially significant because they justify parole grants and denials. Symbolically, narratives of masculinity legitimize the prison’s work of racialized social exclusion and obscure structural dynamics of punishment under accounts of individual difference.;,citation_author=Joss Greene;,citation_author=Isaac Dalke;,citation_publication_date=2021-11;,citation_cover_date=2021-11;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1362480620910222;,citation_issn=1362-4806;,citation_volume=25;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Theoretical Criminology;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding the Effects of Wrongful Imprisonment;,citation_abstract=Concern about cases of wrongful conviction has arisen across different jurisdictions in recent decades. Some wrongly convicted individuals have spent many years in prison before their convictions are quashed, but little is known about the psychological effects of such miscarriages of justice on them. A preliminary descriptive clinical study examined eighteen men referred for psychiatric assessment after their convictions were quashed on appeal and they were released from long-term imprisonment. Substantial psychiatric morbidity and problems of psychological and social adjustment were evident in most cases. The difficulties of the wrongly convicted and their families were similar to those described in the clinical literature concerning other groups, such as war veterans, who have been exposed to chronic psychological trauma. At least some of the postrelease adjustment problems appeared to be a product of long-term imprisonment per se, which suggests that the &amp;amp;amp;quot;prison effects&amp;quot; literature has significant limitations.

Penal bifurcation, policy change and the administration of prisoner release in England and Wales;,citation_abstract=Prisoner release has emerged as a key site of penal policy contestation in England and Wales. A series of crises have undermined public confidence in the parole system and reopened longstanding debates over the confused normative basis of prisoner release policy and practice. This article attempts to locate current concerns within an ideational interpretation of penal policy change. It will argue that prisoner release has been fundamentally re-shaped by a bifurcated penal strategy that emerged as one possible response to the unique challenges of late-modern crime-control. Over time this strategy has provided an enduring guide to collective action and a political template for successive penal reform programmes. However, there are signs that we may now be reaching the conceptual limits of this strategy. While the logic(s) of bifurcation will continue to yield marginal political gains in the short-term, this article concludes that the long-term prognosis is one of diminishing returns with significant implications for the legitimacy, effectiveness and administrative coherence of prisoner release in this jurisdiction.;,citation_author=Thomas Guiney;,citation_publication_date=2019-12;,citation_cover_date=2019-12;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/2066220319895802;,citation_issn=2066-2203;,citation_volume=11;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=European Journal of Probation;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">

In this paper I argue that the institutions we rely upon to make these determinations in a fair, consistent and efficient manner are under increasing strain. Drawing upon insights from historical institutionalism, I seek to show that the parole board model of discretionary decision-making that first emerged during the highwater mark of mid-twentieth century penal modernism has proved remarkably resilient to reform, but is slowly fracturing into a more complex, multi-layered prison release landscape.

Why do ideas such as ’fairness’ and ’freedom’ mean such different things to different people? Why is it so easy to see the flaws in others’ arguments, and less in our own?Jonathan Haidt, one of the world’s most influential psychologists, reveals that the reason we find it so hard to get along is because our minds are designed to be moral. Not only that, we are hardwired to be moralistic, judgemental and self-righteous too. Our intrinsic morality enabled us to form communities and create civilization, and it is the key to understanding everybody. It explains why some of us are liberal, others conservative. It is often the difference between war and peace. It is also why we are the only species that will kill for an ideal. Drawing on moral psychology, ancient philosophy, modern politics, poetry, advertising and the semantics of bumper stickers, Haidt’s incredibly wise and enjoyable book examines how morality evolves; why we are predisposed to believe certain things; how our surroundings can affect our morality; and how moral values are not just about justice and fairness - for some people authority, sanctity or loyalty are more important.Morality binds and blinds, but with new evidence from his own empirical research, Haidt proves it is possible to liberate us from the disputes that divide good people and cooperate with those whose morals differ from our own.

However, while we need to forge greater agreement about the meaning of the term, this is a challenging task. Indeed, if we take “ethnography” to refer to a whole methodological approach little agreement will be possible. I argue that it may be feasible if we treat ethnography as one methodological strategy among others, each having varying advantages and disadvantages for the purposes of investigating particular topics.

The paucity of research on this topic in Europe means that the needs of older prisoners contemplating death in prison have not been established. To investigate elderly prisoners’ attitudes towards death and dying, 35 qualitative interviews with inmates aged 51 to 71 years were conducted in 12 Swiss prisons. About half of the prisoners reported having thought about dying in prison, with some mentioning it in relation with suicidal thoughts and others to disease and old age. Themes identified during data analysis included general thoughts about death and dying, accounts of other prisoners’ deaths, availability of end-of-life services, contact with social relations, and wishes to die outside of prison. Study findings are discussed using Allmark’s concept of “death without indignities,” bringing forth two ethical issues: fostering autonomy and removing barriers. Attributing the identified themes to these two ethical actions clarifies the current needs of ageing prisoners in Switzerland and could be a first step towards the implementation of end-of-life services in correctional systems.;,citation_author=Violet Handtke;,citation_author=Tenzin Wangmo;,citation_publication_date=2014-09;,citation_cover_date=2014-09;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11673-014-9548-x;,citation_issn=1176-7529, 1872-4353;,citation_volume=11;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Bioethical Inquiry;">

Studies have identified a wide range of frequently occurring adverse psychological reactions that commonly affect prisoners in isolation units. The prevalence of psychological distress is extremely high. Nonetheless, use of solitary confinement in the United States vastly increased in recent decades. Advocates defend its use, often citing two recent studies to support claims that isolation has no significant adverse psychological effects, including even on mentally ill people. Those studies, however, are fundamentally flawed, their results are not credible, and they should be disregarded. Critically and comprehensively analyzing the numerous flaws that compromise this recent scholarship underscores the distinction between methodological form and substance, the danger of privileging quantitative data irrespective of their quality, and the importance of considering the fraught nature of the prison context in which research results are actually generated.

Working back from the strategies themselves, I argue that the current generations of risk/need technologies are a significant departure from the pessimistic theoretical accounts of risk in criminal justice associated with the “new penology” and “actuarial justice”. I argue that risk knowledges are fluid and flexible and capable of supporting a range of penal strategies. The evolution and meanings of risk in correctional assessment and classification are examined to show how understandings of risk have shifted from static to dynamic categorizations. I show how the concept of need is fused with risk, how particular conceptions of “need” and “risk” are situated in local penal narratives, how need reconstructs risk and revives correctional treatment as an efficient risk minimization strategy. I argue that strategic alignment of risk with narrowly defined intervenable needs contributes to the production of a transformative risk subject who unlike the “fixed or static risk subject” is amenable to targeted therapeutic interventions. Newly formed risk/ needs categorizations and subsequent management strategies give rise to a new politics of punishment, in which different risk/needs groupings compete for limited resources, discredit collective group claims to resources, redistribute responsibilities for risk/needs management and legitimate both inclusive and exclusionary penal strategies.;,citation_author=Kelly Hannah-Moffat;,citation_publication_date=2005-01;,citation_cover_date=2005-01;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474505048132;,citation_issn=1462-4745, 1741-3095;,citation_volume=7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

Recall is a growing problem: In June 2020, there were 1,359 recalled IPP prisoners. Research documents the negative mental health implications of initial imprisonment under an IPP sentence; however, little is known about experiences on licence, or post-recall. Aims To explain how recalled IPP prisoners perceive being on licence, and in prison post-recall, to affect their mental wellbeing. Methods We draw on 31 interviews with recalled IPP prisoners, conducted for a wider project exploring the high rates of IPP recall. Results Three themes emerged: a perpetual state of anxiety about recall and spending additional years behind bars; self-imposed social isolation, both in the community and in prison; and a profound sense of hopelessness. People often feel trapped in an unjust and inevitable cycle of imprisonment, with little faith in a positive future.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exacerbating risks and diminishing rights for “at-risk” prisoners;,citation_abstract=At-Risk Units (ARUs) are dedicated facilities established in New Zealand prisons to assist those considered to be “at risk” of self-harm or suicide.

Drawing upon research within two correctional sites, alongside analysis of recent documents from oversight bodies and courts, this article considers ARU operations. It is argued that, all too often, ARUs have undermined humane practices towards suicidal or “at-risk” prisoners. Four problems are apparent: (1) ARUs are misused and overused in such a way that secure punishment, rather than care, is prioritized; (2) within a context of “lesser eligibility”, ARUs operationalize degrading conditions and treatments towards prisoners; (3) humane treatments are further diminished by a correctional approach to prioritize legal or bureaucratic compliance; and (4) authorities avoid institutional sanction for prisoner harms or deaths, particularly through an emphasis on personal responsibilization or blame. The end-result is that ARUs are regularly operationalized in ways that exacerbate risks and diminish rights for prisoners.

The literature overview shaped the initial stages of a research project funded by the Department of Health to examine the views and perspectives of prisoners and nurses working in prisons, and to identify good primary care nursing in the prison environment. At total of 17 databases were searched using search terms related to primary healthcare in prisons (health, nurs*, primary care, healthcare, family medicine, prison*, offender*, inmate*) with terms truncated where possible in the different databases. Following this, a sifting phase was employed using inclusion/exclusion criteria to narrow and focus the literature perceived as relevant to the research questions. All papers were critically appraised for quality using standardised tools. Findings from the literature overview show that prisoners are more likely to have suffered some form of social exclusion compared to the rest of society, and there are significantly greater degrees of mental health problems, substance abuse and worse physical health in prisoners than in the general population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Penal Communication in Crown Court Sentencing;,citation_abstract=This dissertation explores the nature of communication in sentencing remarks by judges in three Crown Court sites in South East England in order to form a sound basis for the evaluation of penal practices. It seeks specifically to uncover how, if at all, the notion of penal censure operates in this context. Sentencing is a key aspect of the criminal justice response to offending, and while there is a small but growing strand of research focusing on decision-making in sentencing, very little theoretical or empirical attention has been paid to judges’ approaches to communication at this significant moment. The topic is important for three main reasons: judicial pronouncements at sentencing have the potential to impact defendants’ desistance pathways, to affect victims’ abilities to move on with their lives, and to influence wider public perceptions of the legitimacy of justice, and confidence that criminal justice powers are used rightly. I seek to contribute to our knowledge by presenting a new account of Crown Court sentencing in 21st Century England, and by demonstrating that judicial communication at sentencing carries wider implications for the morality of our penal practices. The thesis is grounded in an empirical study comprising two parts: observation of sentencing in 50 cases involving 58 defendants and covering a range of offences, and a series of semi-structured interviews with 20 Crown Court judges. Most of the observed cases were presided over by the judges I interviewed, providing a rare opportunity to obtain insights into judicial behaviour in real cases from two perspectives. In presenting my findings I demonstrate the chaotic nature of the court context in which sentencing takes place and develop a fourfold typology of communication that emerged from the data: i) judges’ expressive use of ritual denunciation for public audiences, ii) the sharp treatment of defendants in the hope of deterring them from future offending, iii) some efforts to engage with defendants in a counselling manner to promote desistance, and iv) a communicatively arid, professional-focussed approach to sentencing that distances lay participants. By interrogating the nature of these different communicative approaches and judges’ perceptions of them, I illustrate a radical misalignment with censure-based theories of punishment that so readily cite expression as justification, and I highlight four interrelated critical problems for the legitimacy of sentencing. I argue that our current penal practices and their flaws are sustained not only by what defendants are sentenced to, but also by the way in which their sentences are passed.;,citation_author=Thomas Hawker-Dawson;,citation_publication_date=2022-02;,citation_cover_date=2022-02;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.17863/CAM.104329;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of Cambridge;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The health and social needs of older male prisoners;,citation_abstract=Objectives This study aimed to quantify the health and social needs of older male prisoners in the North West of England, to determine whether their needs were being met, and to explore an age cut-off for this group. Methods Data were collected by interview and case note review. Areas covered included physical health, mental health, personality disorder, cognitive impairment and social need. Results A total of 262 prisoners were included in the study. Over 90% had a physical health disorder, most commonly hypertension and osteoarthritis. A total of 61% had a mental disorder, most commonly major depressive disorder and alcohol misuse disorder. There were few differences within age bands for physical health problem or health/social need, but those aged 50–59 years had more mental disorder, including mental illness, substance misuse disorder and personality disorder. Conclusions Older prisoners have a high level of health need and a different profile to the rest of the prison population. Fifty appears to be a useful age over which to define this group, and service provision should reflect this in a national management strategy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Post-traumatic growth in prisoners and its association with the quality of staff–prisoner relationships;,citation_abstract=Background Being sentenced to imprisonment can be traumatic. This may lead to further negative effects, including reoffending or disorders of mental health. Emerging research, however, has suggested that traumatic events can, at times, also lead to post-traumatic growth, leading us to question whether prisoners could experience this. Aims Our aims were to explore the prevalence of post-traumatic growth in prisoners and any association between this and prisoners’ perceptions of the quality of their relationships with staff. Our primary hypothesis was that there would be a positive association between perceptions of the quality of relationships with staff members and post-traumatic growth. We also hypothesised an interaction between staff–prisoner relationships and the extent to which sentencing was experienced as traumatic. Method The Post-traumatic Growth Inventory and the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory were distributed to all 762 prisoners in a high-security prison for adult men in England. First, one-tailed correlations between variables were run, then a hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to test for an interaction between staff–prisoner relationship ratings, trauma of sentencing and post-traumatic growth. Results Just over one fifth of the men (n = 160) returned questionnaires; 76 (48%) had scores indicative of moderate-to-high post-traumatic growth. There was a significant positive association between perceptions of the relationships with staff members and the post-traumatic growth reported. There was no significant interaction between the staff–prisoner relationships and the experience of trauma of imprisonment. Conclusions Our study extends understanding of prisoners through finding that higher levels of self-rated post-traumatic growth were associated with experiencing empathy, positive regard, acceptance and genuineness from prison staff. This highlights the need for high-quality relationships to be adopted in all aspects of prison setting and culture and offers further direction for research into such relationships and their role in promoting positive psychological outcomes.;,citation_author=Natalie Hearn;,citation_author=Stephen Joseph;,citation_author=Sally Fitzpatrick;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1002/cbm.2173;,citation_issn=1471-2857;,citation_volume=31;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health;">

Expanding the narratives about life-sentenced prisoners;,citation_abstract=The number of life-sentenced prisoners in the United States is growing, an increase that deserves ongoing critical consideration.

This psychological tumult occurs against a cultural backdrop in which the label “murderer” “obliterate[s] all other dimensions of the ’person”. The process of reconciling the conviction with one’s sense of self is more complicated for those who have been convicted of murder as a secondary party. Drawing on “body maps” created by prisoners serving life sentences for murder, in which the doctrine of joint enterprise was used at trial, this article illustrates the difficulties young people face in reconciling their sense of who they are with the identity imposed on them by the criminal justice system.;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_author=Tara Young;,citation_publication_date=2022-08;,citation_cover_date=2022-08;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/sites/crimeandjustice.org.uk/files/PSJ\%20261\%2C\%20Body\%20map\%20storytelling.pdf;,citation_issue=261;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Prison Service Journal;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Making Sense of “Joint Enterprise” for Murder: Legal Legitimacy or Instrumental Acquiescence?;,citation_abstract=The legal doctrine of “joint enterprise” has been heavily criticised for lacking legitimacy, primarily linked to distributive (in)justice. This paper draws on the narratives of “joint enterprise prisoners” serving long life sentences for murder, to address such concerns and extend the discussion to questions of “legal legitimacy”. Prisoners who were early in their sentences explicitly rejected the legal legitimacy of joint enterprise, while those at a later stage reported “accepting” their conviction and demonstrated “consent” by engaging with their sentence. We argue that, rather than representing normative acceptance of the legal legitimacy of joint enterprise over time, this acceptance is a form of instrumental acquiescence associated with “dull compulsion” (Carrabine 2004:180), “coping acceptance” (Schinkel 2014:72) and personal meaning making.;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_author=Serena Wright;,citation_publication_date=2019-05;,citation_cover_date=2019-05;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1093/bjc/azz034;,citation_issn=1464-3529;,citation_volume=59;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The British Journal of Criminology;,citation_publisher=Oxford Academic;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The moral weight of murder;,citation_abstract=The act of murder “violates our basic humanity” (Adobor 2022: 336) and raises deep moral questions about how and why a person could kill another human being. Yet little is known about how those who are implicated in a murder morally reflect on their actions. Existing literature focuses on the psychological excuses and justifications that people who have committed offences offer for their behaviour (e.g. Sykes and Matza 1957; see Maruna and Copes 2005 for full review). This paper contributes to a small but growing body of work that explores how individuals living in prison morally reflect on their offence and punishment (see, for example, Ievins 2023, Schinkel 2014, Jarman 2022). Drawing on interviews with men and women convicted of murder at a young age, who had been given long life sentences, this paper presents their moral reflections on the offence. Their narratives exposed the moral burden of being implicated in the killing of another human – a “moral weight” that individuals carried, on a continuum from light to heavy. The relative weight of the burden was shaped by individuals’ reflections on their own moral blameworthiness, the moral blameworthiness of the victim, and the comprehensibility of the offence within the context in which it occurred. The moral weight of the offence was associated with distinctive moral emotions ranging from regret (when “light”) to deep shame (when “heavy”). Reflecting on these findings, I argue two points: firstly, that people convicted of murder engage in the “normal” process of moral reflection to try and make sense of the offence (Maruna and Copes 2005), and use conventional and culturally specific social constructions of murder to do so. But, this is easier for some than others. Secondly, being able to make sense of one’s behaviour in relation to the fatal act is protective, as it lightens the moral load of murder and enables individuals to “move on” with little psychotherapeutic intervention and with a less damaged sense of self, towards a positive future.;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_publication_date=2023-06;,citation_cover_date=2023-06;,citation_year=2023;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=Life and long-term imprisonment;">

The broad findings are consistent with previous work, including few differences being found between the problems experienced as most and least severe by prisoners at different sentence stages. By grouping the problems into conceptual dimensions, and by drawing on interviews conducted with 126 male prisoners, we seek to provide a more nuanced analysis of this pattern. We argue that, while earlier scholars concluded that the effects of long-term confinement were not “cumulative” and “deleterious”, adaptation to long-term imprisonment has a deep and profound impact on the prisoner, so that the process of coping leads to fundamental changes in the self, which go far beyond the attitudinal.;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_author=Serena Wright;,citation_publication_date=2016-07;,citation_cover_date=2016-07;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1093/bjc/azv077;,citation_issn=0007-0955, 1464-3529;,citation_volume=56;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The British Journal of Criminology;">

This article, which is based on more than 129 interviews with men convicted of sex offenses in England &amp;amp; Wales and Norway, uses Cohen’s work on inclusion and McNeill’s typology of rehabilitative forms to complicate this simplistic binary. It argues that the punishment of men convicted of sex offenses in England &amp; Wales was demanding but exclusionary; it imposed strict legal restrictions on these men during and after their imprisonment, blocking them from engaging in social and moral rehabilitation and providing a limited and treacherous route to change. In Norway, punishment operated in a way that was formally inclusionary but surprisingly laissez-faire: Prisoners retained their legal rights during and after their incarceration, but the lack of opportunities to discuss their offending meant that their sentences were rarely experienced as meaningful, and their formal inclusion was not enough for them to feel substantially included after release.;,citation_author=Alice Ievins;,citation_author=Kristian Mjåland;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12276;,citation_issn=1745-9125;,citation_pmid=null;,citation_volume=59;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“Perfectly individualized and constantly visible”? Lateral tightness in a prison holding men convicted of sex offences;,citation_abstract=Late-modern penal power has been described as “tight”. Through the increasing use of indeterminate sentences and psychological assessment, and the growing insistence that prisoners engage in self-government, the prison monitors and seeks to change those it holds. This tight and disciplinarian power is often described as contributing to the increasing fragmentation and atomisation of the prisoner community. However, this article, which is based on research conducted in a English medium-security prison for men convicted of sex offences, argues that tightness can operate through the prisoner community, in a process which it terms “lateral regulation”. It shows that prisoners spend a lot of time observing, categorising and policing their peers, in ways which replicate and often uphold the more formal systems of power. However, the relationship between these two systems of power is complex, and prisoners’ collective self-regulation can conflict with and challenge the demands of the penal institution, in a way which reveals some of the weaknesses in the institution’s disciplinary gaze, and indicates the normative motivations underlying this regulation.;,citation_author=Alice Ievins;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/2632666320936433;,citation_issn=2632-6663;,citation_volume=1;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Incarceration;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">

Others tried to use the prison as a space for reinvention, but it was too disconnected from their biographies for this change to endure.

This book examines the ways in which prisons are morally communicative institutions, instilling in prisoners particular ideas about the offenses they have committed-ideas that carry implications for prisoners’ moral character. Investigating the moral messages contained in the prosaic yet power-imbued processes that make up daily life in custody, Ievins finds that the prison she studied communicated a pervasive sense of disgust and shame, marking the men it held as permanently stained. Rather than promoting accountability, this message discouraged prisoners from engaging in serious moral reflection on the harms they had caused. Analyzing these effects, Ievins explores the role that imprisonment plays as a response to sexual harm, and the extent to which it takes us closer to and further from justice&amp;quot;–;,citation_author=Alice Ievins;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_isbn=978-0-520-38371-5;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Gender and justice;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Moral messages, ethical responses: Punishment and self-governance among men serving life sentences for murder;,citation_abstract=This PhD uses theoretical and conceptual resources from the anthropology of morality and ethics to explore moral communication in the contemporary life sentence, as seen through the ethical lives of men serving life sentences for murder. Empirically, it describes three things. First, moral communication *about murder*: what a conviction for this crime and the experience of imprisonment for life “said” to prisoners about who they were and whom they ought to become. Second, moral communication *within a life course*: how people with different pre-prison experiences reacted to the rupture in identity imposed by the sanction. Third, moral communication *through the language of risk*: an unclear (though dominant) medium which imposed demands some lifers found a comfortable “fit”, but others did not. These descriptions draw on interview and documentary data relating to forty-eight individuals: thirty in a long-term category-B prison, and eighteen in a category-D or “open” prison focused on resettlement. All serving mandatory life sentences for murder, they were otherwise a heterogeneous group: convicted in diverse circumstances, aged from their teens to their seventies, and sentenced between 1983 and 2017. Their minimum terms ranged in length from less than ten to thirty years, and they had served between 7% and 250% of these minimums. Both in their backgrounds and in their custodial experiences, then, they formed a broad and diverse sample, affording a wide range of perspectives on the theoretical and substantive questions addressed by the research. The PhD adds theoretical depth and empirical detail to a growing literature on experiences of long-term and life imprisonment. It also comments on some implications of this empirical material for how retributive penal theorists have understood the *aims* of punishment—in particular, whether long-term imprisonment succeeds in communicating to prisoners what is *wrong* (as opposed to merely *harmful*) about taking life. It argues, overall, that the mandatory life sentence as currently delivered is a morally incoherent sanction. On the one hand, it is too individualised to convey clear moral norms or to show meaningful solidarity with those harmed and wronged by murders. On the other, it is not individualised enough to communicate effectively with murderers about the ethical responses that their actions might warrant.;,citation_author=Ben Jarman;,citation_publication_date=2024-06;,citation_cover_date=2024-06;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.17863/CAM.109063;,citation_language=en-GB;,citation_dissertation_institution=Apollo - University of Cambridge repository;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Only one way to swim? The offence and the life course in accounts of adaptation to life imprisonment;,citation_abstract=Recent studies of long-term imprisonment describe a largely invariant pattern of prisoner adaptation. Using data from a qualitative study of men serving life sentences in England, I argue that adaptation may in fact vary more than these studies imply both because of the prisoner’s age when sentenced and because of the circumstances of particular offences. Participants’ engagement with the prison’s rehabilitative “offer” depended on how the sentence affected their life course and what they understood to be the moral ramifications of the offence. These findings refine understanding of adaptation and suggest that a renewed focus on moral reflexivity may bear fruit in future prison research.;,citation_author=Ben Jarman;,citation_publication_date=2020-10;,citation_cover_date=2020-10;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1093/bjc/azaa036;,citation_issn=0007-0955;,citation_volume=60;,citation_language=en-GB;,citation_journal_title=The British Journal of Criminology;,citation_publisher=Oxford Academic;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Turning points or dead ends? Identity, desistance and the experience of imprisonment;,citation_abstract=Desistance research has pushed criminologists to develop a nuanced conceptual account of criminal identity and human agency. However, these tools have mostly not been used to consider identity changes among long-sentenced prisoners, despite the growing preponderance of long-term imprisonment in England and Wales. As a result of this, desistance theory has not been used to evaluate the administration of indeterminate sentences, meaning that practitioners may be missing out on some of the insights that it can generate. This qualitative study begins to fill that gap, using a phenomenological analysis of eighteen in-depth semi-structured interviews with life- sentenced prisoners at a single prison in England, all of whom had been convicted of murder. It argues that most eventually attempt conscious projects of personal change during imprisonment; second, that many frame change in terms which are not consistent with the official discourses of risk reduction (which govern their progression through the sentence); and third, that how they themselves conceive and pursue personal change is affected by their position in the sentence and the life course, and also by the specific nature and circumstances of their index offences. The analysis classifies four different styles of agency found in the sample: “defensive” and “fractured” agents were unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for the offence, and were consequently in penal “dead ends”; while “corrective” and “redemptive” agents had encountered “turning points”, in that they accepted responsibility, albeit in different ways. The analysis describes each group’s characteristic ways of describing the offence and their part in it. It also describes their attitudes to prison social life in general, and to rehabilitative intervention in particular. The study as a whole suggests that much of the personal change which lifers themselves frame as significant happens outside rehabilitative interventions, and may be invisible to key prison staff. This raises important questions about whether prisons and prisoners think about rehabilitation in the same way, with consequences for the legitimacy of penal power.;,citation_author=Ben Jarman;,citation_publication_date=2017-08;,citation_cover_date=2017-08;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.17863/CAM.33383;,citation_language=en-GB;,citation_dissertation_institution=Apollo - University of Cambridge repository;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Researching the prison;,citation_abstract=Researching the prison can be a challenging, fascinating, fatiguing, exhilarating, exhausting, tedious, poignant business. This chapter provides a brief potted history of some of the ’classic’ sociological studies of prisons, prisoners and prison staff, against a backdrop of the political and policy contexts in which they were conducted. It takes the reader through the process of doing research in prisons – frequently summarized as ’getting in, getting on and getting out’. The chapter describes the emotional dimensions of researching the prison; what it feels like to observe and, to some degree, participate in the everyday, interior world of the prison. As Crewe, many accounts of doing prison research suggest that it is ’intense, unpredictable and emotionally taxing’, yet fail to note that it is ’rarely dangerous’, with both prisoners and prison staff being ’generally welcoming’ to the researchers in their midst.;,citation_author=Yvonne Jewkes;,citation_author=Serena Wright;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_isbn=978-1-315-79777-9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_inbook_title=Handbook on Prisons;">

Original interviews with a sample of prisoners (condemned prisoners and life-without-parole prisoners) and prison officers are used to develop a picture of the experience of life under sentence of death by incarceration. It is argued that offenders sentenced to death by incarceration do not pose a special danger to others in the prison world or in the free world and that the suffering they experience is compara- ble to the suffering endured by condemned prisoners.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Imperative for Inclusion of Long Termers and Lifers in Research and Policy: Forgotten Prisoners;,citation_abstract=Research Summary\nAlthough numerous studies have highlighted the negative consequences of\nmass incarceration, life-course and criminal career research has largely\nfailed to document psychological, social, and behavioral changes that\noccur during periods of incarceration. This oversight is particularly\nnoteworthy in the case of individuals serving long sentences, as they\nspend a significant portion of the life course behind bars. The policies\nand programs targeting prisoners are seldom tailored to long termers and\nlifers, and we know little about effective interventions, or even how to\nmeasure effectiveness, for this population. By drawing on the relevant\nempirical research, this article underlines the importance of\nreorienting some research efforts and policy priorities toward\nindividuals serving life or otherwise long prison sentences.\nPolicy Implications\nDuring the last 20 years, the prevalence of life sentences has increased\nsubstantially in the United States. We argue that there are various\nbenefits to developing policies that consider the challenges and issues\naffecting long termers and lifers. In addition to the ethical and human\nrights concerns associated with the treatment of this population, there\nare several pragmatic justifications for this argument. Long termers and\nlifers spend a substantial number of years in prison, but most are\neventually released. These individuals can play a key role in shaping\nthe prison community and potentially could contribute to the development\nof a healthier prison climate. Investment in the well-being of\nindividuals serving long sentences may also have diffused benefits that\ncan extend to their families and communities. It would be advantageous\nfor correctional authorities and policy makers to consider the\npotentially pivotal role of long termers and lifers in efforts to\nmitigate the negative consequences of incarceration.;,citation_author=Lila Kazemian;,citation_author=Jeremy Travis;,citation_publication_date=2015-05;,citation_cover_date=2015-05;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/1745-9133.12126;,citation_issn=15386473;,citation_volume=14;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminology &amp;amp;amp; Public Policy;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ethical life: Its natural and social histories;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;quot;The human propensity to take an ethical stance toward oneself and others is found in every known society, yet we also know that values taken for granted in one society can contradict those in another. Does ethical life arise from human nature itself? Is it a universal human trait? Or is it a product of one’s cultural and historical context? Webb Keane offers a new approach to the empirical study of ethical life that reconciles these questions, showing how ethics arise at the intersection of human biology and social dynamics. Drawing on the latest findings in psychology, conversational interaction, ethnography, and history, Ethical Life takes readers from inner city America to Samoa and the Inuit Arctic to reveal how we are creatures of our biology as well as our history–and how our ethical lives are contingent on both. Keane looks at Melanesian theories of mind and the training of Buddhist monks, and discusses important social causes such as the British abolitionist movement and American feminism. He explores how styles of child rearing, notions of the person, and moral codes in different communities elaborate on certain basic human tendencies while suppressing or ignoring others.&amp;quot;–Publisher’s Web site;,citation_author=Webb Keane;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_isbn=978-0-691-16773-2;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treating Persons as Means;,citation_abstract=Sometimes it is morally wrong to treat persons as means. When a personsays that someone is treating him merely as a means, forexample, he often implies that she is failing to abide by a moralnorm. Ethically disapproving judgments that a person is “justusing” or sometimes simply “using” another arecommon in everyday discourse (e.g., Goldman &amp;amp;amp; Schmidt 2018).Authors appeal to the idea that research on human subjects (Levine2007: 140; Van der Graaf and Van Delden 2012), management of employees(Haywood 1918: 217), and criminal punishment (Duff 1986:178–179) is wrong if it involves treating persons merely asmeans. The notion that treating people in that way is morallyproblematic has appeared in debate regarding terrorism (Card 2010:131), pornography (Baird &amp; Rosenbaum 1998: 103, 106), andsurrogate motherhood (Macklin 1994: 64). However, treating others asmeans or, equivalently, using them is frequently morally permissible.Waiters use customers to get tips; customers treat waiters as means tocuisine; professors use students to test their ideas; students useprofessors to gain expertise, and so forth. Under what conditions isusing another wrong? Philosophers since Kant have tried to answer thisquestion, at least in part, by offering accounts of when a person usesanother and does or does not just use the other, or,equivalently, treat him merely as a means. These accountstend to be controversial. Precise sets of conditions for treating (ornot treating) persons merely as means seem to have implications thatto some extent clash with everyday understanding of doing so.Moreover, for Kantians, the prohibition on treating persons merely asa means is a moral constraint: it limits what we may do, even in theservice of promoting the overall good. If a surgeon extracting vitalorgans from an unwilling “donor” would maximize the good,say, by preserving the lives of five people desperate for transplants,she would be treating the donor merely as a means and thereby actingwrongly, Kantians would say. Kant himself suggests that thisconstraint is absolute. The principle Kant deems to be the supremeprinciple of morality, the categorical imperative, deems morally wrongall actions that treat persons merely as means. But is it plausible tohold that all such actions are wrong? Upon reflection, is it evenplausible to hold that to treat persons merely as means is, typically,to act wrongly, rather than just to have an ethicallyinappropriate attitude towards them?;,citation_author=Samuel Kerstein;,citation_editor=Edward N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Navigating moral dimensions and lateral power – The experiences of men with sexual convictions and histories of sexual abuse serving sentences in a therapeutic community;,citation_abstract=This article examines the moral world of therapeutic penal communities through the lens of the experiences of men with sexual convictions and histories of sexual victimisation. Drawing on the concepts of lateral power and stigma, we discuss how Therapeutic Communities (TCs), which are intensely social communities, operate within three moral dimensions: the institutional set of therapeutic norms, the con code, and the broader sociocultural set of norms that intensely stigmatise sexual offending. Specifically, the focus of this article is how these norms shape the manner in which lateral power is used, navigated and resisted within TCs. We explore the manner in which TC processes are used as tools to enact lateral power over men with sexual offences, and how the three moral dimensions create a messy moral environment within the TC. Importantly, we explore how the residents navigate the morally complex dual identity of offender and victim. We also note that the moral messiness, and the conflicts between the moral dimensions, also raise challenges for how vertical institutional power is exercised. Finally, we point out that the neoliberal individualism inherent in today’s sociocultural moral dimension further shapes how men with sexual offences experience the moral community of the TC.;,citation_author=Anna Kotova;,citation_author=Geraldine Akerman;,citation_publication_date=2022-03;,citation_cover_date=2022-03;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/26326663221074263;,citation_issn=2632-6663;,citation_volume=3;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Incarceration;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Segregation Seekers: An Alternative Perspective on the Solitary Confinement Debate;,citation_abstract=Recent calls from senior managers, human rights groups and academics continue to scrutinize the impact of solitary confinement. But much less attention has been paid to prisoners’ own motivations for segregation. By analysing interviews with 16 segregated men in a high-security prison (Category-A) in England, this article foregrounds motivation. The argument involves a detailed description of the complex, and sometimes contradictory, motives that may lead prisoners into seeking isolation. It further attempts to explore the relationship between segregation and the wider prison environment. For many prisoners, segregation has a “negative benefit” or amounts to a form of “lesser evil”.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Forgotten Men: Serving a Life without Parole Sentence;,citation_abstract=Today there are approximately fifty thousand prisoners in American prisons serving life without parole, having been found guilty of crimes ranging from murder and rape to burglary, carjacking, and drug offences. In The Forgotten Men , criminologist Margaret E. Leigey provides an insightful account of a group of aging inmates imprisoned for at least twenty years, with virtually no chance of release. These men make up one of the most marginalized segments of the contemporary U.S. prison population. Considered too dangerous for rehabilitation, ignored by prison administrators, and overlooked by courts disinclined to review such sentences, these prisoners grow increasingly cut off from family and the outside world. Drawing on in-depth interviews with twenty-five such prisoners, Leigey gives voice to these extremely marginalized inmates and offers a look at how they struggle to cope. She reveals, for instance, that the men believe that permanent incarceration is as inhumane as capital punishment, calling life without parole “the hard death penalty.” Indeed, after serving two decades in prison, some wished that they had received the death penalty instead. Leigey also recounts the ways in which the prisoners attempt to construct meaningful lives inside the bleak environment where they will almost certainly live out their lives. Every state in the union (except Alaska) has the life-without-parole sentencing option, despite its controversial nature and its staggering cost to the taxpayer. The Forgotten Men provides a much-needed analysis of the policies behind life-without-parole sentencing, arguing that such sentences are overused and lead to serious financial and ethical dilemmas.;,citation_author=Margaret E.

Examining Differences in Treatment Response Among Male Incarcerated Persons;,citation_abstract=Research examining the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing recidivism has paid little attention to treatment factors contributing to response variability. Using an archival sample of 448 participants exposed to a risk-need-responsivity (RNR)-informed CBT program or no treatment, a multigroup latent profile analysis yielded a four-profile solution: a treatment-nonresponsive group and three treatment-responsive groups. Among the treatment-responsive profiles, reduced criminal attitudes were most predictive of desistance from reoffending. Elevated rates of recidivism and negligible gains following treatment were associated with pretreatment elevations in antisocial traits, risk level, and negative attitudes toward treatment. These findings underscore a greater need for individualized assessment of risk and treatment motivation, the importance of altering criminal sentiments to prevent reentry into the system upon release, and challenge the idea that 200 hours of treatment is sufficient for lasting change. Study limitations and further directions are discussed, including the need for correctional treatment outcome research to better isolate individual differences.;,citation_author=Michael E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Are Hope and Possibility Achievable in Prison?;,citation_abstract=There is both hope and frustration in this article. A recent research exercise in a prison found it to be inspirational in its ethos, relationships and mission. Prisoners talked passionately about their experiences in it and its impact on their personal development. But prisoners received very little resettlement support and things sometimes went wrong as soon as they were released, not because of any “moral failings” on their part, but because they could not even navigate the journey “home”.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Doing Research in Prison: Breaking the Silence?;,citation_abstract=This article reflects on some of the tensions experienced in doing prison research. Both qualitative and quantitative “styles of research”—in so far as they can be characterized as discrete styles—have their dangers and rewards. The “truths” of sociology’s concern with humanistic method and its discoveries of the painfulness of prison are valid, and yet need to be reconciled with quantitative findings about the apparent ordinariness of prison for generalized groups of prisoners, about differences between prisoners and individual instances of violence/suicide/disorder, whose origins may have individual-psychological as well as situational-sociological components, and about the distinctions which may be drawn between prisons—some having more legitimate regimes than others. The absence of “pain” from quantitative research accounts of prison life is surprising. The author argues that research in any human environment without subjective feeling is almost impossible—particularly in a prison. These feelings—belonging to staff, prisoners and researchers—can be a significant guide to or even source of valuable data. Recent accounts of the role of emotion in criminology and in research have been helpful in making sense of some of the turbulence discovered and experienced by members of the research team involved in a recent project.;,citation_author=Alison Liebling;,citation_publication_date=1999-05;,citation_cover_date=1999-05;,citation_year=1999;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1362480699003002002;,citation_issn=1362-4806;,citation_volume=3;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Theoretical Criminology;">

Two of the most serious challenges faced by researchers “at the deep end” are the emotional demands and the threats to integrity encountered when methods or findings are regarded as “suspect.” These challenges are worth the struggle. The collective aim of prison scholarship is to make the prison world “intelligible,” to make “moral blindness” less likely or possible. Rich description is akin to actual experience and as such amplifies life, and enlarges sympathies, in ways that can “reshape human consciousness and with it the structure of society.” Research is reform, or it can be, as we strive to reconceptualize, or articulate, the strange and painful world that is the prison.;,citation_author=Alison Liebling;,citation_publication_date=2014-04;,citation_cover_date=2014-04;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1077800413516273;,citation_issn=1077-8004;,citation_volume=20;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Qualitative Inquiry;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=After life imprisonment: Reentry in the era of mass incarceration;,citation_abstract=One out of every ten prisoners in the United States is serving a life sentence—roughly 130,000 people. While some have been sentenced to life in prison without parole, the majority of prisoners serving “life” will be released back into society. But what becomes of those people who reenter the everyday world after serving life in prison? In After Life Imprisonment, Marieke Liem carefully examines the experiences of “lifers” upon release. Through interviews with over sixty homicide offenders sentenced to life but granted parole, Liem tracks those able to build a new life on the outside and those who were re-incarcerated. The interviews reveal prisoners’ reflections on being sentenced to life, as well as the challenges of employment, housing, and interpersonal relationships upon release. Liem explores the increase in handing out of life sentences, and specifically provides a basis for discussions of the goals, costs, and effects of long-term imprisonment, ultimately unpacking public policy and discourse surrounding long-term incarceration. A profound criminological examination, After Life Imprisonment reveals the untold, lived experiences of prisoners before and after their life sentences.;,citation_author=Marieke Liem;,citation_publication_date=2016-09;,citation_cover_date=2016-09;,citation_year=2016;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/577783;,citation_isbn=978-1-4798-6074-6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_book_title=After Life Imprisonment;,citation_series_title=New perspectives in crime, deviance, and law series;">

We sought to empirically assess whether there is a recognizable post-incarceration syndrome that captures the unique effects of incarceration on mental health. We conducted in-depth life interviews with 25 released “lifers” (individuals serving a life sentence), who served an average of 19 years in a state correctional institution. We assessed to what extent the symptoms described by the participants overlapped with other mental disorders, most notably PTSD. The narratives indicate a specific cluster of mental health symptoms: In addition to PTSD, this cluster was characterized by institutionalized personality traits, social–sensory disorientation, and alienation. Our findings suggest that post-incarceration syndrome constitutes a discrete subtype of PTSD that results from long-term imprisonment. Recognizing Post-Incarceration Syndrome may allow for more adequate recognition of the effects of incarceration and treatment among ex-inmates and ultimately, successful re-entry into society.;,citation_author=Marieke Liem;,citation_author=Maarten Kunst;,citation_publication_date=2013-05;,citation_cover_date=2013-05;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=3-4;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2013.04.012;,citation_issn=01602527;,citation_volume=36;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Defences of the Weak: A Sociological Study of a Norwegian Correctional Institution;,citation_abstract=This is a sociological study of a Norwegian penal institution. The author spent two years in the institution, observing and interviewing inmates and staff, the target being to learn the extent to which American prisons fit with prison life in a different culture. He gives a fascinating answer to the question: Norwegian prisons were, at the time of the study, miles away from their American counterparts. The conflicts between prison officers and inmates were certainly there, but they took a very different form. Rather than engaging in deviant practices and norms, emphasising more or less solidary opposition against the staff, the Norwegian prisoners criticised the staff and the prison fiercely on the basis of their own norms; rather than engaging in deviance, they turned the common practises and norms of Norwegian society against the staff, engaging in a kind of moral surveillance of those in power. He coined the phrase of &amp;amp;amp;quot;censoriousness&amp;quot; to this approach from the &quot;bottom&quot; of the prison. Mathiesen spells out the major causes of this different approach, from characteristics of this particular prison to broader social forces.;,citation_author=Thomas Mathiesen;,citation_publication_date=2012-11;,citation_cover_date=2012-11;,citation_year=2012;,citation_isbn=978-1-136-28409-0;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Routledge Revivals;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Duff on Hard Treatment;,citation_abstract=This chapter considers whether Duff’s communicative account of punishment can justify penal hard treatment. It first gives a sympathetic account of Duff’s communicative theory and the arguments that he offers to connect censure and hard treatment. Duff claims that hard treatment can be both a means to bring the offender to a rich, penitential, understanding of his crime and a vehicle through which the offender can express his repentance and restore himself to his community. It is argued that neither of these moves is successful in justifying the use of hard treatment. Hard treatment requires a consequentialist justification and Duff recoils from this because he believes all such justifications fail to treat agents with due respect. This is a mistake and reducing future offending is a justifiable goal of penal public policy.;,citation_author=Matt Matravers;,citation_publication_date=2011-07;,citation_cover_date=2011-07;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199592814.001.0001/acprof-9780199592814-chapter-5;,citation_isbn=978-0-19-172903-4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_inbook_title=Crime, Punishment and Responsibility: The Jurisprudence of Antony Duff;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Two Virtue Ethics and the Anthropology of Morality;,citation_abstract=There has been a recent call for an anthropology of morality and a challenge to anthropologists that they have been insufficiently attentive to moral aspects of social life. The new anthropology of morality involves an attempt to modify the legacy associated with Durkheim and the idea of the moral as confined to unreflective norm following. Out of this has emerged a new interest in virtue ethics. In this paper, I examine points of convergence and crucial differences between a “first-person” or “humanist” virtue ethics and a postructural one inspired largely by Foucault. Despite their many convergences, poststructural and first-person versions of virtue ethics make not only distinct but in some cases irreconcilable claims. Instead of rushing to merge these positions, I would urge that we pause to look at how they differ and see why this debate might matter to our own ethnographic enterprises.;,citation_author=Cheryl Mattingly;,citation_publication_date=2012-06;,citation_cover_date=2012-06;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1463499612455284;,citation_issn=1463-4996;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Anthropological Theory;">

In the third part of the paper, I explore the nature of the relationship between desistance theories and rehabilitation theories, so as to develop my concluding argument; that is, that debates about psychological rehabilitation have been hampered by a failure to engage fully with debates about at least three other forms of rehabilitation (legal, moral, and social) that emerge as being equally important in the process of desistance from crime.;,citation_author=Fergus McNeill;,citation_publication_date=2012-02;,citation_cover_date=2012-02;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.2044-8333.2011.02039.x;,citation_issn=2044-8333;,citation_volume=17;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Legal and Criminological Psychology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mass supervision, misrecognition and the “Malopticon”;,citation_abstract=This paper aims to contribute to debates about “mass supervision” by exploring its penal character as a lived experience. It begins with a review of recent studies that have used ethnographic methods to explore how supervision is experienced before describing the two projects (“Supervisible” and “Mass Supervision: Seen and Heard”) on which the paper draws, explaining these as an attempt to generate a “counter-visual criminology” of mass supervision. I then describe two encounters with “Teejay”; encounters in which we explored his experiences of supervision firstly through photography and then through song-writing. Both media are presented alongside Teejay’s commentary on what he sought to convey, inviting the reader to engage with and interpret the pictures and song. In the concluding discussion, I offer my own analysis, arguing that Teejay’s representations suggest a need to recognize mass supervision as “Maloptical” as much as “Panoptical”. Through the “Malopticon”, the penal subject is seen badly, is seen as bad and is projected and represented as bad. Experiences of misrecognition and misrepresentation constitute significant yet poorly understood pains of supervisory punishment. The paper concludes by suggesting several ways in which a counter-visual criminology might follow Teejay’s lead in exposing and challenging of mass supervision.;,citation_author=Fergus McNeill;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474518755137;,citation_issn=1462-4745;,citation_volume=21;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

In considering life after release from prison, qualitative data relating to hoped-for, feared and expected possible selves was generated by 34 young fathers aged between 18 and 21 years. The most common categories of hoped-for and expected selves related to employment and parenting, whereas feared selves related predominantly to offending or a return to prison. The prevalence of possible selves relating to parenting suggests that parenthood is a key component of the representations of present and future identity of young fathers in prison. Findings are discussed in relation to the positive aspect of parenthood for young men in prison, parenting identities in the transition from custody to community, future research directions and the development of interventions targeting young fathers in prison.;,citation_author=Rosie Meek;,citation_publication_date=2011-10;,citation_cover_date=2011-10;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.12.005;,citation_issn=01401971;,citation_volume=34;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Adolescence;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exploring the Mandatory Life Sentence for Murder;,citation_abstract=Murder is often regarded as both the “ultimate” and a unique crime, and whereas courts are normally given discretion in sentencing offenders, for murder the sentence is mandatory – indeterminate imprisonment. Since the crime and the punishment come as a “package deal” this book looks at both the legal nature of the offence and at the current operation of the mandatory life sentence. Not only does the book adopt a critical approach, by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo, it also draws upon comparative material from both common and civil law jurisdictions in an attempt to provide a comprehensive exploration of these issues. The need for public confidence in the criminal justice system is particularly acute in the way it deals with the most serious homicides. In this book the authors report findings from the first systematic exploration of public attitudes to sentencing murder in this or any other common law jurisdiction. The picture of public opinion emerging from this recent large-scale nationwide qualitative and quantitative survey, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, is likely to surprise many, and will be of interest to all jurisdictions where the mandatory life sentence for murder has been questioned.;,citation_author=Barry Mitchell;,citation_author=Julian V.

However, based on qualitative interviews with prisoners serving shorter sentences in England &amp;amp; Wales and Norway, we found that the offence was very rarely discussed in meaningful ways during the imprisonment itself. The paper explores this tension between the moral judgement embedded in the multi-fold judicial processes leading up to imprisonment and the following absence of meaningful conversations about the action(s) that caused people to be imprisoned in the first place. Drawing on these perspectives, we understand the offence as an “absent-present” in the prison, which can lead to confusion and misplaced shame (Ievins 2019), but also foster positive relationships between the men and women who live and work here (Mjåland &amp; Laursen 2021). We end by discussing how different moral and social environments in prison enable or crush moral self-reflection among people who have been found guilty of an offence.;,citation_author=Kristian Mjåland;,citation_author=Julie Laursen;,citation_publication_date=2022-07;,citation_cover_date=2022-07;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prisoners, solitude, and time;,citation_abstract=Prisoners, Solitude, and Time is an examination of two overlapping aspects of the prison experience that, despite their central importance, have not attracted the scholarly interest they deserve. The first of these is the degree to which prisoners can withstand the rigours of solitude. While the deleterious effects of penal isolation are well known, little systematic attention has been given to the factors associated with surviving, and even triumphing over, prolonged exposure to solitary confinement. The second is how prisoners experience the temporal dimension of their lives, in particular the “survival stratagems” they deploy to reduce the potentially overwhelming prospect of a long, or even indefinite, period behind bars. The book focuses on an aspect of the prison experience—time, its meanderings, measures and meanings—that is seldom considered by academic commentators. It pays particular attention to the use of administrative segregation in what have become known as supermax prisons. The argument advanced in the book is built upon a wide range of prisoner narratives which are analysed in conjunction with academic critiques, official publications, personal communications, field visits, newspaper articles, administrative statistics, the reports of campaigning bodies, and other data. The book concludes with a series of reflections on hope, the search for meaning, post-traumatic growth, and the art of living.;,citation_author=Ian O’Donnell;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_isbn=978-0-19-968448-9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Clarendon studies in criminology;">

Over half of establishments had some contact with external social care services, but reported significant difficulties in arranging the care for individuals. A professional lead for older prisoners had been identified in 81% of establishments; however, the value of this role to positively affect practice appeared questionable.

This book provides a fascinating case study of a little-known part of the criminal justice system, and explores at the same time the wider issues that have arisen - in particular the impact of the ECHR and the Human Rights Act on the criminal justice system; the relationship between the Parole Board and the Prison and Probation Services; the differences between release procedures for different categories of life sentence prisoner, and those detained compulsorily under the Mental Health Act;the broader social, legal and political context in which DLPs operate, and the nature of discretionary decision-making in the criminal justice system field. the first detailed study - from a leading authority in the field - of the way decisions are reached on discretionary life sentence prisoners explores the impact of the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the Human Rights Act on the working of the criminal justice system of interest to practitioners and academics concerned with the criminal justice system.;,citation_author=Nicola Padfield;,citation_publication_date=2002;,citation_cover_date=2002;,citation_year=2002;,citation_isbn=978-1-84392-423-4;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Desistance and the &amp;amp;amp;quot;feared self&amp;quot;: Toward an identity theory of criminal desistance;,citation_abstract=This Article develops both a framework for a theory of desistance from crime and an analytical strategy with which to examine desistance. With respect to the former, an identity theory of the desistance from crime that is more cognitive and individualistic than some and more forward-looking than others is sketched out. This framework contributes to and complements existing theoretical arguments by building upon the work of others through integrating several diverse bodies of work that range from social psychology to collective movements in sociology. In this framework, offenders have ”working selves” as criminal offenders with a set of preferences and social networks consistent with that self In addition to the working self, or the self in the present, there is a future, or possible, self that consists both of desires as to what the person wishes or hopes to become (the positive possible sell) and anxiety over what they fear they may become (the feared sell). Persons are committed to their working self until they determine that the cost of this commitment is greater than the benefits. A perception that one may in fact turn out to become the feared self, a perception assisted by the linking of life failures, or what has been called the ”crystallization of discontent, ”provides the initial motivation to change the self. This initial motivation brings with it a change in preferences and social networks that stabilize the newly emerging self This identity theory of desistance can be empirically developed by thinking about it in terms of a structural break in an individual-level time series of offending. This theory and the process of desistance itself can be profitably examined by examining such time series of offending over a long time period at the individual level.;,citation_author=Raymond Paternoster;,citation_author=Shawn D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“It’s Sort of Reaffirmed to Me That I’m Not a Monster, I’m Not a Terrible Person”: Sex Offenders’ Movements Toward Desistance via Peer-Support Roles in Prison;,citation_abstract=Individuals incarcerated in prisons across the United Kingdom and abroad are able to volunteer for a variety of peer-support roles, which are characterized by prisoner-to-prisoner helping. Some research has found that such roles can represent turning points in the lives of those who have offended and encourage movements toward desistance. This proposed redemptive influence is argued to result from the prosocial behaviors that such roles appear to elicit in their holders. The present study aims to explore the mechanics of this claimed influence. While a limited amount of research has attempted this on a general offending population, no research has done so with a sample of sexual offenders. Given the intensive treatment programs involved in such contexts, and the requirements for sexual offenders to demonstrate reduced risk, the authors believe those serving time for sexual offenses represent an important sample on which to explore the potentially redemptive properties of peer-support roles. To this end, 13 peer supporters participated in semistructured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using a phenomenologically oriented thematic analysis. Results suggest that sexual offenders who adopt peer-support roles are able to live up to desired selves by “doing good” in prison, “giving back,” and consequently resisting negative labels. These benefits have been theoretically linked with better reintegration outcomes for sexual offenders, who are publicly denigrated in the extreme and find it especially difficult to (re)integrate. Suggestions regarding the future utility of such schemes are offered.;,citation_author=Christian Perrin;,citation_author=Nicholas Blagden;,citation_author=Belinda Winder;,citation_author=Gayle Dillon;,citation_publication_date=2018-10;,citation_cover_date=2018-10;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1177/1079063217697133;,citation_issn=1079-0632;,citation_volume=30;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

Discovering his own existence as a thinking entity in the very exercise of doubt, he goes on to prove the existence of God, who guarantees his clear and distinct ideas as a means of access to the truth. He develops new conceptions of body and mind, capable of serving as foundations for the new science of nature. Subsequent philosophy has grappled with Descartes’s legacy, questioning many of its conclusions and even his basic approach, but his arguments set the agenda for many of the greatest philosophical thinkers, and their fascination endures. This new translation includes the Third and Fourth Objections and Replies in full, and a selection from the rest of these exchanges with Descartes’s contemporaries that helped to expound his philosophy.

One group of men had all served at least eight years of their sentence; the other had all served less than i8 months of comparable sentences. There was a significant degree of agreement between the two groups on the relative severity of the problems, suggesting that long-term imprisonment does not necessarily have progressive or cumulative effects on inmates’ day-to-day experience of problems in their situation. Also, both groups sorted most problems into the ” Myself” category, indicative of general agreement on the importance of self-reliance as a coping strategy. Those problems rated as least severe related to experience of more extreme psychological disturbance; on the whole the men did not see imprisonment as a fundamental threat to their mental health. Those rated as most severe related to the deprivation of relationships in and with the outside, rather than to the privations of prison life. Some implications of this for penology and for the psychology of institutional experience are discussed.;,citation_author=Barry Richards;,citation_publication_date=1978;,citation_cover_date=1978;,citation_year=1978;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.bjc.a046888;,citation_issn=02729490;,citation_volume=18;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The British Journal of Criminology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dying inside: Deaths from natural causes in prison culture, regimes and relationships;,citation_abstract=This thesis considers what happens when a prisoner in England dies from natural causes. It explores the impact of deaths from natural causes on prison regimes, culture and relationships and demonstrates what determines the responses of prison regimes and personnel to dying prisoners. It is significant because to date there have been no studies of these deaths which considers their impact on the prison as an institution. Data collected using ethnographic methods in two prisons in the north of England in 2017 and 2018 shows how staff and prisoners understand the carceral geography of death and dying, construct the identity of the dying prisoner and define quality end of life care. The thesis concludes that, within limits, deaths from natural causes in prison custody soften the usual distinctions between what is expected or not expected, permitted or not permitted, between “inside” and “outside” prison. This is both tangible and intangible in prison regimes, culture and relationships and informs the responses of prison regimes and personnel to dying prisoners. The thesis challenges existing literature by demonstrating care quietly permeating through prison culture. It considers palliative care in prisons more holistically than existing studies, which are often limited to the medical care of terminally ill prisoners. It argues that in the perception of prisoners and staff, prison changes death, and death changes prison.;,citation_author=Carol Robinson;,citation_publication_date=2019-09;,citation_cover_date=2019-09;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/26503/;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of York;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Late-modern rehabilitation: The evolution of a penal strategy;,citation_abstract=In a number of recent analyses, rehabilitation has been portrayed as a casualty of processes of penal transformation, coming to be frequently characterized as “dead” or “irrelevant”. This article takes issue with such a characterization in the specific penal context of England &amp;amp;amp; Wales, and seeks to explain why rehabilitation is currently enjoying a renewed legitimacy. The central argument is that rehabilitation, in this jurisdiction, has adapted and survived into the 21st century by transforming and remarketing itself in important ways. Central to this transformative process has been a successful appeal to three dominant “late modern” penal narratives: utilitarian, managerial and expressive. It is argued that in the contemporary (Anglo-Welsh) penal context, rehabilitation enjoys legitimacy to the extent that it is compatible with each of these narratives.;,citation_author=G.

This work has revealed a large number of factors that are related to desistance. To date, these explanations have been generally perceived as mutually exclusive and/or competitive. Interestingly, while research on desistance from crime has been a recent focus, certain work had examined crime over the life-course as far back as the early 20th century. In particular, the Gluecks offered one of the earliest “theories” of desistance, focusing on maturation. Their “maturation theory” was somewhat tautological and not well specified. However, the Gluecks were clear that further work was needed in order to specify what maturation means and how it relates to crime. In this article, five domains of maturation are articulated drawing on the literature in the life-course and developmental fields.

This book uniquely addresses this area, examining the narratives of long-term prisoners with a special focus on the meaning they ascribe to their sentence, its impact on their lives and how it affects their inclination to offend in the future. Through a range of in-depth narrative interviews with male prisoners at different stages of their sentences, Schinkel considers their views on the legitimacy of their sentence, analysing what factors play a role in the shaping of these perspectives including life circumstances and the effects of rehabilitation. Exploring what purposes of punishment prisoners support and perceive as achieved by their sentence, the book argues that the need to survive the prison environment and the need to tell a progressive narrative outweighed the individual characteristics of each case, leading prisoners to accept their sentence even when they had cause to oppose it.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Punishment as moral communication: The experiences of long-term prisoners;,citation_abstract=This article examines for the first time to what extent the lived experience of long-term prisoners matches the normative theory of criminal punishment as moral communication. The findings are based on 27 narrative interviews with men at different stages of a long-term prison sentence. The analysis suggests that Antony Duff’s normative vision of punishment as moral communication may be difficult to realise in practice because of the inevitable pressures on defendants in the courtroom and on prisoners during their incarceration. In the court, the men’s attention was focused on the length of the sentence imposed; they were often overwhelmed by emotion and did not interact with the court as a moral arena. Within prison the men tended to accept their sentence in order to make bearing their incarceration easier. Comparing these men’s lived experiences of punishment with Duff’s normative theory highlights problems with the theory’s potential implementation but also reveals normative problems with current practices of sentencing and sanctioning.;,citation_author=Marguerite Schinkel;,citation_publication_date=2014-12;,citation_cover_date=2014-12;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474514548789;,citation_issn=1462-4745, 1741-3095;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

This article examines the interaction between trajectories of parenthood and trajectories of desistance in order to understand how these interact over time. Methods This article is based on life story interviews with 29 men and women in Scotland who had experienced repeated short-term imprisonment and mentioned children as significant in their lives, ten of whom were interviewed again 2 years later. Results While becoming pregnant was a (very) positive turning point for many of the women, trauma surrounding parenthood through pregnancy loss, lack of conception and losing the parental role had a clear negative effect on trajectories of desistance.Men had similar experiences, although pregnancy was only a turning point for them if they felt their partner was not fulfilling their role as mother-to-be.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Death by prison: The emergence of life without parole and perpetual confinement;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;quot;In recent decades, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (LWOP) has developed into a distinctive penal form in the United States, one firmly entrenched in US policy-making, judicial and prosecutorial decision-making, correctional practice, and public discourse. LWOP is now a routine part of contemporary US criminal justice, even engrained in the nation’s cultural imaginary, but how it came to be so remains in question. Fifty years ago, imprisoning a person until death was an extraordinary sentence; today, it accounts for an increasing percentage of all US prisoners. What explains the shifts in penal practice and the social imagination by which we have become accustomed to imprisoning individuals until death without any reevaluation or reasonable expectation of release? Combining a wide historical lens with detailed state- and institutional-level research, Death by Prison offers a provocative new foundation for questioning this deeply problematic practice that has escaped close scrutiny for too long. The rise of life without parole, this book demonstrates, is not simply a matter of growth: it is a phenomenon of change, inclusive of changes in definitions, practices, and meanings. Death by Prison shows that the complex processes by which life without parole became imprisonment until death and perpetual confinement became a routine part of American punishment must be understood not only in terms of punitive attitudes and political efforts but as a matter of background conditions and transformations in penal institutions. The book also reveals how the social and sociological relevance of life without parole extends beyond its punitive element: imbued in the history of life without parole are a variety of forms of disregard–for human dignity, for social consequences, and for the myriad responsibilities that go along with state punishment&amp;quot;–;,citation_author=Christopher Seeds;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_isbn=978-0-520-37997-8 978-0-520-37998-5;">

This article draws from hope studies in other disciplines to advance a model of types of hope, which is then used to analyse evidence of hope in prior criminological literature on life sentences and long prison terms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Until we reckon: Violence, mass incarceration, and a road to repair;,citation_abstract=In the eloquent tradition of Bryan Stevenson’s Just Mercy, an award-winning leader in the movement to end mass incarceration takes on the vexing problem of violent crime. Although over half the people incarcerated in America today have committed violent offenses, the focus of reformers has been almost entirely on nonviolent and drug offenses. Danielle Sered’s brilliant and groundbreaking Until We Reckon steers directly and unapologetically into the question of violence, offering approaches that will help end mass incarceration and increase safety. Widely recognized as one of the leading proponents of a restorative approach to violent crime, Sered asks us to reconsider the purposes of incarceration and argues persuasively that the needs of survivors of violent crime are better met by asking people who commit violence to accept responsibility for their actions and make amends in ways that are meaningful to those they have hurt–none of which happens in the context of a criminal trial or a prison sentence. Sered launched and directs Common Justice, one of the few organizations offering alternatives to incarceration for people who commit serious violent crime and which has produced immensely promising results. Critically, Sered argues that the reckoning owed is not only on the part of those who have committed violence, but also by our nation’s overreliance on incarceration to produce safety–at great cost to communities, survivors, racial equity, and the very fabric of our democracy;,citation_author=Danielle Sered;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_isbn=978-1-62097-479-7;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Perils of Parole Hearings: California Lifers, Performative Disadvantage, and the Ideology of Insight;,citation_abstract=Abstract Following a series of transformative political and legal battles, California’s overcrowded prison system has moved in the direction of moderate decarceration. A softer stance on punishment means that thousands of previously ineligible inmates serving indeterminate sentences are now being considered for release on parole. Drawing on ethnographic observations of twenty parole hearings in one California men’s prison, this study outlines how rehabilitation has come to be enmeshed in a logic of punitivity, as parole commissioners subject inmates to an individualizing gaze that misrecognizes the socially embedded nature of their performance. Parole commissioners are tasked with assessing dangerousness, deploying a multifaceted conception of risk that combines formalized actuarial instruments and evaluative judgments to form the inchoate and contradictory notion of ?insight.? Inmates are expected to demonstrate this if they are to be released, but what is insight? Parole boards assume that it is a valid indicator of future behavior and probable recidivism, and parole commissioners posit that successful inmates will be capable of demonstrating authentic remorse and insight, unimpeded by the constraints of an austere and dangerous carceral environment. However, the discretionary criteria established by the penal system are limited by the deleterious living conditions established by this same penal system.;,citation_author=Victor L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychologists as “the quiet ones with the power”: Understanding indeterminate sentenced prisoners’ experiences of psychological risk assessment in the United Kingdom;,citation_abstract=Prisoners serving indeterminate sentences in the United Kingdom do not know when or if they will be released from prison. Release and progression decisions are determined by the risk the ISP presents of reoffending. This makes the assessment of risk a high stakes business for ISPs. Whilst there is a large body of literature focused on prisoners’ general experiences of prison, there is an absence of specific empirical exploration of prisoners’ experiences of risk assessment. This paper aims to address this gap by reporting the results of a qualitative exploration of ISPs’ experiences of psychological risk assessment. Interviews with 10 ISPs were conducted and analysed using Grounded Theory methods. Analysis indicated that prisoners experienced the prison environment as characterised by violence, volatility and suffering. Psychological risk assessment is embedded within this emotionally and physically challenging context but also contributes to the experience of suffering. Within this context, prisoners felt stuck, powerless and out of control in relation to risk assessment, and experienced psychologists as untrustworthy yet powerful. Understanding prisoners’ experiences is the first step in resolving some of the long-reported difficulties in working relationships between psychologists and prisoners as well as making the process more procedurally just.;,citation_author=Jo Shingler;,citation_author=Stefanie J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Risk Assessment Interviews: Exploring the Perspectives of Psychologists and Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoners in the United Kingdom;,citation_abstract=This study explores the forensic risk assessment interview from the perspectives of qualified prison-based psychologists and indeterminate sentenced prisoners in the United Kingdom. It focuses on the psychologist–prisoner relationship in the interview context. Twenty-one in-depth individual interviews were conducted with psychologists and prisoners and analysed using Grounded Theory methods. The analysis identified the following categories reflecting participants’ descriptions of risk assessment interviews: “Emphasising Clarity and Transparency,” “Collaborative Engagement,” “Making a Respectful, Boundaried yet Human Connection,” “Respecting Individuality,” and “Having a Purposeful Conversation.” Analysis demonstrated that these categories of meaning reflected the broader notion of risk assessment interviewing as “A Difficult Balancing Act.” The views of prisoners and psychologists about the risk assessment interview were remarkably similar and provide some direction and guidance for practitioners navigating this challenging but essential aspect of forensic psychological work.;,citation_author=Jo Shingler;,citation_author=Stefanie J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“Their life in your hands”: The experiences of prison-based psychologists conducting risk assessments with indeterminate sentenced prisoners in the United Kingdom;,citation_abstract=Assessing prisoners’ risk of recidivism and making risk-management recommendations is central to the work of prison-based psychologists. Risk assessment is particularly crucial when it involves indeterminate sentenced prisoners: psychologists’ recommendations have potentially significant consequences both for prisoners and the public. However, little is known about psychologists’ experiences of conducting such high stakes risk assessments. This paper reports the results of an exploration of psychologists’ experiences, via interviews and discussions with qualified, prison-based psychologists. Analysis using Grounded Theory methods identified one super-ordinate category of meaning, namely The Challenging Context of Risk Assessment, which comprised two sub-categories: (1) pressure of limited resources and (2) pressure of the environment. An additional major category, Risk Assessment as a Weighty Task, comprised three sub-categories: psychologists described (1) a weight of responsibility relating to the magnitude and range of their responsibilities; (2) a weight of expectation from colleagues to provide solutions, and (3) the trainee dilemma associated with the need to balance development of trainee psychologists’ competence in risk assessment with being held accountable for their work. Understanding qualified psychologists’ experiences of undertaking risk assessments with indeterminate sentenced prisoners can facilitate improvements and build on areas of existing good practice.;,citation_author=Jo Shingler;,citation_author=Stefanie J.

This study refutes such an argument and is consistent with research demonstrating that LWOP inmates do not pose a disproportional risk for disciplinary misconduct. Results from our study comparing LWOP with parole-eligible, life-sentenced (LWP) inmates revealed neither significant differences in the total violation count nor the time to commission of an act of disciplinary misconduct. Trajectories of misconduct showed slightly higher prevalence of misconduct among LWOP inmates, a pattern of declining prevalence during the first 18 months of confinement, and a convergence with LWP inmates thereafter.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Ideology of Victim Precipitation;,citation_abstract=A review of the explicit and the implicit uses of the concept &amp;amp;amp;quot;victim precipitation&amp;quot; in criminology and the criminal justice system is presented. The pervasiveness of the &quot;ideology of victim precipitation&quot; indicates chat it is much more fundamental to the official American justice system and its crime prevention programs and strategies than is generally recognized or suspected. An analysis of the various contexts in which the concept is utilized or implied suggests that it is preceded, either directly or indirectly, by a particular political judgment about the nature of crime and its control or prevention. Specifically criminological and justice system uses of &quot;victim precipitation&quot; assume consistently that crime is individually generated ant therefore, can only be individually prevented. At least two repressive ideological effects flow from these assumptions of victim precipitation&quot;: (1) an extreme form of victim-blame where the victims of crime are said to be a primary cause of their own victimization, and (2) underlying support for ineffective official crime prevention strategies and programs (in reality &quot;victim prevention&quot; strategies and programs) that instruct citizens to take responsibility for their own criminal victimization (&quot;dress less seductively,&quot; &quot;leave your lights on,&quot; &quot;lock or bar your window,&quot; etc.). The &quot;ideology of victim precipitation&quot; – by blaming the individual crime victim – only serves to divert attention and resources away from the structural causes of crime and the structural changes required by a less criminogenic society, and renders the existing social, political and economic orders more legitimate. In this way, the social relations required by capitalist society are reproduced by this ideology. It is concluded that the ideology of victim precipitation has no place in a progressive criminology or progressive criminal justice system that attempts to identify how crime is generated and prevented structurally. This criminology and criminal justice practice attempts to spot those social, political, and economic, institutional sources of crime in American society that must be transformed if crime is to be significantly controlled or prevented.;,citation_author=Doug A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The nature and extent of prisoners’ social care needs: Do older prisoners require a different service response?;,citation_abstract=SummaryIn light of longstanding concern about the lack of social care in prisons, the 2014 Care Act made local authorities in England responsible for identifying, assessing and meeting prisoners? social care needs. However, service planning is difficult, for little is known about the level of demand or the extent to which the needs of older and younger prisoners differ. Against this background, face-to-face interviews (including screens for social care needs, substance misuse and mental health problems) were undertaken with a sample of male prisoners in North-West England.FindingsThree hundred and ninety-nine participants were aged 18?49 and 80 aged 50 plus. Overall, more than a 10th of participants had problems maintaining personal hygiene, dressing and/or getting around the prison safely; a significant minority lacked meaningful occupation; and approaching a sixth acknowledged problems forming/maintaining relationships. Older prisoners were significantly more likely than younger prisoners to need help with personal hygiene, dressing and moving around safely and to identify problems with their physical health and memory.ApplicationsThe findings highlight the substantial number of older prisoners who could potentially benefit from some form of social care and support if they are to maintain their safety and dignity and make best use of their time in prison. They also underline the need to develop suitable screening and assessment tools for older prisoners, and for further research on the best service models for prisoners requiring intimate personal care.;,citation_author=Sue Tucker;,citation_author=Claire Hargreaves;,citation_author=Mark Cattermull;,citation_author=Amy Roberts;,citation_author=Tammi Walker;,citation_author=Jennifer Shaw;,citation_author=David Challis;,citation_publication_date=2019-11;,citation_cover_date=2019-11;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/1468017319890077;,citation_issn=1468-0173;,citation_volume=21;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Social Work;,citation_publisher=SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“Always gotta be two mans”: Lifers, risk, rehabilitation, and narrative labour;,citation_abstract=All prisoners have their identity stripped from them and, ultimately, reconstructed by the institutions in which they are incarcerated. However, for life and indeterminately sentenced prisoners the effects of this process, reinforced over extended periods, creates a particular set of burdens. For it is this population, above and beyond that of other prisoners, who need to address the implications of an imposed carceral identity in both navigating the day-to-day life of the prison and securing release. The four core burdens are firstly, an ambiguity on what identity indeterminately sentenced prisoners were supposed to have. Secondly, reconciling an imposed identity that they did not necessarily feel adhered to their pre-established sense of self. Thirdly, recognition that in order to operate or perform within the prison they needed to adopt an institutionally acceptable form of their self. Fourthly, that they had to manage how their performance of self was judged and recorded by the prison. This article aims to contribute to the growing body of work on Narrative Criminology by arguing that these burdens results in what I define as narrative labour.;,citation_author=Jason Warr;,citation_publication_date=2020-01;,citation_cover_date=2020-01;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/1462474518822487;,citation_issn=1462-4745;,citation_volume=22;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Punishment &amp;amp;amp; Society;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Crime and Regret;,citation_abstract=Recent developments in neuroscience and social science are illuminating the critical importance of regret in human choices, including criminal decision making. After differentiating regret from related emotions (e.g., disappointment, sadness, shame), I argue that regret can prompt desistance from crime and that regret avoidance is a powerful mechanism of conformity. I then turn to American and European penal history to demonstrate that the invention of the prison was premised on the notion that solitary confinement could inculcate regret in prisoners and thereby change them profoundly. The place of regret in both historical and emerging thinking about human choice underscores its importance for understanding the connections between emotions and criminality.;,citation_author=Mark Warr;,citation_publication_date=2016-07;,citation_cover_date=2016-07;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/1754073915586818;,citation_issn=1754-0739, 1754-0747;,citation_volume=8;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Emotion Review;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fifty - the new sixty? The health and social care of older prisoners;,citation_abstract=The fastest growing sector of the prison population is older people. Although the numbers are still relatively small (just under 2,500 in 2007), it would seem that the “sameness” principle within prisons renders older prisoners invisible. The health of older prisoners is a matter of concern - research indicates that you age 10 years faster in prison (Uzoaba, 1998) which can compound the problems that may be associated with ageing. The provision of health and social care do not match those for older people outside of the prison system. This article considers the legal issues surrounding the treatment of older prisoners. It recognises that restrictions on liberty are a component of the prison system; however, it questions whether the consequences of “sameness” infringe the legal rights of older prisons. It recommends a statutory presumption of equivalence of care, which can only be rebutted expressly or by necessary implication.;,citation_author=John Williams;,citation_publication_date=2010-01;,citation_cover_date=2010-01;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.5042/qiaoa.2010.0525;,citation_issn=1471-7794;,citation_volume=11;,citation_journal_title=Quality in Ageing and Older Adults;,citation_publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited;">

Order, leadership, political charge and violence in two maximum security prisons;,citation_abstract=Sociological studies of prisons require expanded methodologies and interdisciplinary concepts to address challenges posed by changing prisoner demographics and transformed geopolitics. We aim to revitalize sociological inquiry on prisons and prisoner leadership by focussing on the question of whether prisons cause radicalization. Our findings support those of the most persuasive original studies: distinct prison climates generate different hierarchies, only some of which are violent. Through extensive fieldwork we explore the differences between a prison with high levels of “political charge”, or anger, and another with less, drawing on extremist events that unfolded over time. We contrast the dangerous dynamics of prison 1 with the more fluid, prosocial religious explorations facilitated by prison 2, considering the implications for prison radicalization studies.;,citation_author=Ryan Williams;,citation_author=Alison Liebling;,citation_publication_date=2023-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1093/bjc/azab122;,citation_issn=0007-0955;,citation_volume=63;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The British Journal of Criminology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Suppression, denial, sublimation: Defending against the initial pains of very long life sentences;,citation_abstract=The central purpose of the article is to explore the psychic components of the early pains of imprisonment described by male and female prisoners serving very long mandatory life sentences for murder. While there is a strong tradition of documenting prisoners’ adaptations to “life inside”, little work in prisons sociology explores how lifesentenced prisoners, specifically those convicted of murder, reactively respond and adjust to the early years of these sentences. Having outlined prisoners’ descriptions of entry shock, temporal vertigo and intrusive recollections, we draw upon a Freudian terminology of “defence mechanisms of the ego” to argue that suppression, denial and sublimation represent key ways of “defending against” (rather than “adapting to”) these experiences. We suggest that the particular offence–time nexus of our sample—the specific offence of murder combined with a very long sentence—helps to explain these defensive patterns.;,citation_author=Serena Wright;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_publication_date=2017-05;,citation_cover_date=2017-05;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1362480616643581;,citation_issn=1362-4806, 1461-7439;,citation_volume=21;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Theoretical Criminology;">

The article aims to bridge the existing gap between jurisprudence and sociological accounts on hope and life imprisonment by extending this debate to men and women serving reducible life sentences in England and Wales, for whom release is not guaranteed but assumed to be attainable. Through focusing on the individual ways in which the spectre and procedural elements of release shape narratives of hope and hopelessness, this article agrees with Vannier that recent human rights debates have fallen short in terms of subjectively understanding the complex relationship between “hope” and “release” for life-sentenced prisoners. It concludes by highlighting the necessity of procedural legitimacy in reducing uncertainty and promoting and maintaining hope among this group.;,citation_author=Serena Wright;,citation_author=Susie Hulley;,citation_author=Ben Crewe;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/13624806211067770;,citation_issn=1362-4806;,citation_volume=27;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Theoretical Criminology;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Doing time: A qualitative study of long-term incarceration and the impact of mental illness;,citation_abstract=Once convicted, the perpetrator of serious crime embarks upon a new journey: the challenge of adjusting to long-term imprisonment. Prisoners’ views of incarceration and the meaning of this experience may affect their later adjustment to life in the community. On the basis of brief narrative responses collected during an epidemiological survey of the psychological health of prisoners in France, this study examined the impact of incarceration on psychological state in a group of 59 inmates serving long sentences. Qualitative content analysis and computer-assisted linguistic analysis (using ALCESTE software) were performed on the textual data of open responses to three standard questions. Using a combination of these two approaches, seven categories of the subjective experience of prisoners in the sample were identified: the Outside World. Others, Punishment, Time, Affects and Impulses, Self-Concept, and Speech. Further qualitative analyses were then performed to compare the responses of Severely Mentally III (SMI) subjects and subjects with no psychiatric disorder. These analyses revealed contrasting attitudes towards incarceration. SMI subjects spoke in more hostile and persecutory terms about their experience in prison, attributing suffering to external circumstances, while subjects with no psychiatric disorder evoked similar themes. but with an introspective attitude. The themes evoked by mentally ill individuals in our sample suggest that their reactions to the prison environment arise in part from aspects of their psychiatric symptoms, and this may have relevance to future mental health policy and practices in criminal corrections.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Behavior and Adaptation in Long-Term Prison Inmates: Descriptive Longitudinal Results;,citation_abstract=A comprehensive set of measures of behavior, emotional states, and cognitions was gathered longitudinally for a sample of long-term prison inmates across more than 7 years from the beginning of their terms. Over time they became more involved in work and other structured activities, and less involved in casual socializing with other inmates, but their rates of contact with people on the outside were maintained. These changes were accompanied by evidence of improved adaptation, including considerable decreases over time in dysphoric emotional states, and also decreases in stress-related medical problems and the number of disciplinary incidents. Although these beneficial effects cannot easily be interpreted as the effects of long-term imprisonment, the entire pattern of results provides strong evidence against expectations of widespread or generalized deleterious effects.;,citation_author=Edward Zamble;,citation_publication_date=1992-12;,citation_cover_date=1992-12;,citation_year=1992;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/0093854892019004005;,citation_issn=0093-8548;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminal Justice and Behavior;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Moral breakdown and the ethical demand: A theoretical framework for an anthropology of moralities;,citation_abstract=Recently social scientists in general and anthropologists in particular have invoked the concept of morality in their studies. The use of this concept is seen by many as a way to bypass the complexities and contradictions of such traditional social scientific concepts as culture, society and power. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly evident that in many of these studies morality is used in a way that may be more reminiscent of the moral understanding of the social scientist than that of their subjects. Therefore, a well-founded anthropology of moralities must break from this assumption and rethink the ways in which the moral can be explicitly studied. By engaging in a dialogue with 20th-century continental philosophies of sociality and ethics, this article articulates a theory and model by which an explicit anthropology of moralities becomes possible. Two ethnographic examples, utilizing very different methodological techniques and focusing on two very different societies, are used to illustrate the strength of this theory as a framework for a proper anthropological study of local moralities.;,citation_author=Jarrett Zigon;,citation_publication_date=2007-06;,citation_cover_date=2007-06;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1463499607077295;,citation_issn=1463-4996, 1741-2641;,citation_volume=7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Anthropological Theory;">

      <p>This PhD uses theoretical and conceptual resources from the anthropology of morality and ethics to explore moral communication in the contemporary life sentence, as seen through the ethical lives of men serving life sentences for murder. Empirically, it describes three things. First, moral communication <em>about murder</em>: what a conviction for this crime and the experience of imprisonment for life ‘said’ to prisoners about who they were and whom they ought to become. Second, moral communication <em>within a life course</em>: how people with different pre-prison experiences reacted to the rupture in identity imposed by the sanction. Third, moral communication <em>through the language of risk</em>: an unclear (though dominant) medium which imposed demands some lifers found a comfortable ‘fit’, but others did not. These descriptions draw on interview and documentary data relating to forty-eight individuals: thirty in a long-term category-B prison, and eighteen in a category-D or ‘open’ prison focused on resettlement. All serving mandatory life sentences for murder, they were otherwise a heterogeneous group: convicted in diverse circumstances, aged from their teens to their seventies, and sentenced between 1983 and 2017. Their minimum terms ranged in length from less than ten to thirty years, and they had served between 7% and 250% of these minimums. Both in their backgrounds and in their custodial experiences, then, they formed a broad and diverse sample, affording a wide range of perspectives on the theoretical and substantive questions addressed by the research. The PhD adds theoretical depth and empirical detail to a growing literature on experiences of long-term and life imprisonment. It also comments on some implications of this empirical material for how retributive penal theorists have understood the <em>aims</em> of punishment—in particular, whether long-term imprisonment succeeds in communicating to prisoners what is <em>wrong</em> (as opposed to merely <em>harmful</em>) about taking life. It argues, overall, that the mandatory life sentence as currently delivered is a morally incoherent sanction. On the one hand, it is too individualised to convey clear moral norms or to show meaningful solidarity with those harmed and wronged by murders. On the other, it is not individualised enough to communicate effectively with murderers about the ethical responses that their actions might warrant.</p>
