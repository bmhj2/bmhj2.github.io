    Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 prisoners to gather
    information about the characteristic features of short prison sentences.
    Themes raised in comments included: the frequency and quality of sentences,
    addiction, family, and penal legitimacy. Most of the participants had
    extensive experience of prison, and the effects of this played out across
    sentences and years, accumulating and amplifying impacts. And, despite
    expressions of guilt and remorse, most participants saw their sentence as
    unjust, and mainly a reaction to offending history. We conclude by
    suggesting the need for research to shift focus from evaluating individual
    penal interventions towards more holistic and narrative accounts that cut
    across sentences.

    Abstract:
                  There is a paucity of literature focusing on the challenges involved in undertaking qualitative research with convicted sexual offenders. This article will address the challenges faced by the researchers whilst conducting fieldwork with convicted sexual offenders in the prison environment and how they overcame them. Such obstacles included the recruitment of participants, informed consent, establishing researcher‐participant rapport, avoiding collusion and ensuring confidentiality and anonymity. This article further reflects on the social, political and ethical‐legal dilemmas, as well as the emotional aspects (both for the researcher and participant) of researching such populations. Although the focus here is on researching sexual offenders in prison, the experiences will no doubt have resonance for those undertaking research with other vulnerable populations.

    The ‘pains of imprisonment’ have been a longstanding concern within prison
    sociology. This article revisits the topic, suggesting that modern penal
    practices have created some new burdens and frustrations that differ from
    other pains in their causes, nature and effects. It notes that the pains of
    imprisonment can be divided up conceptually, and to some degree
    historically, into those deriving from the inherent features of
    incarceration, those resulting from deliberate abuses and derelictions of
    duty, and those that are consequences of systemic policies and institutional
    practices. Having described the latter in detail – focusing on the pains of
    indeterminacy, the pains of psychological assessment and the pains of
    self-government, the article explains the relevance of the concept of
    ‘tightness’, as well as ‘depth’ and ‘weight’, to the contemporary prison
    experience.

    As many scholars have noted, women remain peripheral in most analyses of the
    practices and effects of imprisonment. This article aims to redress this
    pattern by comparing the problems of long-term confinement as experienced by
    male and female prisoners, and then detailing the most significant and
    distinctive problems reported by the latter. It begins by reporting data
    that illustrate that the women report an acutely more painful experience
    than their male counterparts. It then focuses on the issues that were of
    particular salience to the women: loss of contact with family members;
    power, autonomy and control; psychological well-being and mental health; and
    matters of trust, privacy and intimacy. The article concludes that
    understanding how women experience long sentences is not possible without
    grasping the multiplicity of abuse that the great majority have experienced
    in the community, or without recognizing their emotional commitments and
    biographies.

    Based on a survey administered in 13 prisons in England &amp; Wales and
    Norway, as part of a research programme with explicitly comparative aims,
    this article seeks to address both the relative and absolute dimensions of
    the Nordic penal exceptionalism thesis. It outlines the consistently more
    positive results in Norway compared to England &amp; Wales, explaining them
    primarily with reference to the former’s much higher quality and use of open
    prisons. At the same time, it emphasizes that, even in an unusually humane
    prison system, prisoners report considerable pain and frustration. The
    article also makes the case that comparative analysis should strive to be
    systematic, but that such comparisons are always imperfect, making
    methodological transparency all the more essential.

    While the use of imprisonment continues to rise in developed nations, we
    have little sociological knowledge of the prison's inner world. Based on
    extensive fieldwork in a medium-security prison in the UK, HMP
    Wellingborough, this book provides an in-depth analysis of the prison's
    social anatomy. It explains how power is exercised by the institution,
    individualizing the prisoner community and demanding particular forms of
    compliance and engagement. Drawing on prisoners' life stories, it shows how
    different prisoners experience and respond to the new range of penal
    practices and frustrations. It then explains how the prisoner society — its
    norms, hierarchy, and social relationships — is shaped both by these
    conditions of confinement and by the different backgrounds, values, and
    identities that prisoners bring into the prison environment.

  abstract: >-
    Prison scholarship has tended to focus on the pains and frustrations that
    result from the use and over-use of penal power. Yet the absence of such
    power and the subjective benefits of its grip are also worthy of attention.
    This article begins by drawing on recent literature and research findings to
    develop the concept of ‘tightness’ beyond its initial formulation. Drawing
    primarily on data from a study of men convicted of sex offences, it goes on
    to explain that, in some circumstances, the reach and hold of penal power
    are not experienced as oppressive and undesirable, and, indeed, may be
    welcomed. Conversely, institutional inattention and an absence of grip may
    be experienced as painful. Prisons, then, can be ‘loose’ or ‘lax’ as well as
    ‘tight’. The article then discusses the different ways in which prisons
    exercise grip, and, in doing so, recognise or misrecognise the subjectivity
    of the individual prisoner. It concludes by identifying the connections
    between this ‘ground-up’ analysis of the relative legitimacy of different
    forms of penal intervention and recent discussions in penal theory about the
    proper role of the state in communicating censure and promoting personal
    repentance and change.

    The aims of retributive or nonutilitarian sentencing are said to conflict
    with parole as part of a determinate sentencing framework. In this article,
    we claim that a nonutilitarian approach to punishment does not necessarily
    conflict with parole. In particular, by adopting core elements of Duff's
    framework of communicative sentencing, we argue that parole inherently holds
    a communicative meaning in the form of retributive whisper and can thus be
    reconciled with a nonutilitarian approach to punishment. In addition, we
    explore a way to enhance the communicative potential in the parole process
    and suggest that by recognizing and further incorporating the inherent
    communicative message in parole we can increase or maximize the board's
    communicative potential. Finally, we discuss some benefits that can emerge
    from adapting a communicative sentencing framework to the parole process.

  abstract: >-
    This paper aims to analyze the relevance given to violent deaths and
    imprisonment by male homicide perpetrators in their biographical
    reconstructions. Drawing on narrative criminology, this study examines the
    offenders’ emic terms, rationalities, and stories. The analysis is based on
    seventy-three purposefully selected narrative-biographical interviews and
    field observations in prisons and homes of former convicts (2016-2020) in
    Metropolitan Buenos Aires, Argentina. The corpus was analyzed following an
    inductive thematic coding strategy using ATLAS.ti. Three central narratives
    about homicide and incarceration emerged: “opportunity,” “rock bottom,” and
    “disruptive.” For most, homicide was described as a biographical opportunity
    to rethink their lives, pursue new pathways, and “stabilize” a previously
    uncontrolled lifestyle. However, homicides perpetrated by respondents with
    higher socioeconomic status were disruptive events. Participants used stoic
    rationality—the positive appraisal of painful experiences—to structure their
    sense-making and stories of violence. This rationality permeated
    perpetrators’ presentations of themselves, their turning points and lived
    experiences, and the violence performed and suffered. This paper grapples
    with the widespread assumption that homicide is a radical change in the
    lives of offenders and questions the universal meaning of violent death.
    Performing violence is not only neutralized but is also seen as an expected
    and inaugural event in life stories, dependent on the worldviews of the
    social actors.

  abstract: >-
    The question "What can justify criminal punishment ?" becomes especially
    insistent at times, like our own, of penal crisis, when serious doubts are
    raised not only about the justice or efficacy of particular modes of
    punishment, but about the very legitimacy of the whole penal system. Recent
    theorizing about punishment offers a variety of answers to that
    question-answers that try to make plausible sense of the idea that
    punishment is justified as being deserved for past crimes; answers that try
    to identify some beneficial consequences in terms of which punishment might
    be justified; as well as abolitionist answers telling us that we should seek
    to abolish, rather than to justify, criminal punishment. This book begins
    with a critical survey of recent trends in penal theory, but goes on to
    develop an original account (based on Duff's earlier Trials and Punishments)
    of criminal punishment as a mode of moral communication, aimed at inducing
    repentance, reform, and reconciliation through reparation-an account that
    undercuts the traditional controversies between consequentialist and
    retributivist penal theories, and that shows how abolitionist concerns can
    properly be met by a system of communicative punishments. In developing this
    account, Duff articulates the "liberal communitarian" conception of
    political society (and of the role of the criminal law) on which it depends;
    he discusses the meaning and role of different modes of punishment, showing
    how they can constitute appropriate modes of moral communication between
    political community and its citizens; and he identifies the essential
    preconditions for the justice of punishment as thus conceived-preconditions
    whose non-satisfaction makes our own system of criminal punishment morally
    problematic. Punishment, Communication, and Community offers no easy
    answers, but provides a rich and ambitious ideal of what criminal punishment
    could be-an ideal of what criminal punishment cold be-and ideal that
    challenges existing penal theories as well as our existing penal theories as
    well as our existing penal practices.

    Background Existing research explores Parole Board decision-making, but not
    specifically for perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV), a special
    case due to the gendered and secretive nature of IPV and the role of control
    in predicting reoffending. Aim To identify associations between case
    variables in England and Wales Parole Board decisions regarding perpetrators
    of IPV and explore how these variables help construct the decision. Methods
    Logistic regressions regarding decisions in a sample of all 137 male
    prisoners who had abused women and applied for release or progression to
    open conditions in England and Wales from April 2018 to September 2019,
    developed into latent class analyses. Thematic analyses of six interviews
    with Parole Board members about decision-making in IPV cases. Results
    Release decisions were strongly predicted by the recommendations of offender
    managers, offender supervisors and psychologists, mediated by the Parole
    Board's confidence in their ability. Decisions were also significantly
    associated with custodial behaviour and attendance on courses, mediated by
    the Board's confidence in the prisoner's insight and honesty. Thematic
    analysis was both consistent with these findings and provided a context in
    which the associations could be understood. Conclusions The findings have
    implications for understanding the dynamics between professional decisions
    and the Parole Board's decision; for the importance of offender managers
    demonstrating their expertise and ability to manage risk; for Parole Board
    members' reflection and development; for academic research into IPV; and for
    those who have experienced IPV and are looking to understand parole
    decisions about their abuser.

  abstract: >-
    The new penology argues that an important new language of penology is
    emerging. This new language, which has its counterparts in other areas of
    the law as well, shifts focus away from the traditional concerns of the
    criminal law and criminology, which have focused on the individual, and
    redirects it to actuarial consideration of aggregates. This shift has a
    number of important implications: It facilitates development of a vision or
    model of a new type of criminal process that embraces increased reliance on
    imprisonment and that merges concerns for surveillance and custody, that
    shifts away from a concern with punishing individuals to managing aggregates
    of dangerous groups, and that afects the training and practice of
    criminologists.

    Qualitative data offer rich insights into the social world, whether alone or
    in tandem with statistical analysis. However, qualitative data are costly to
    collect and analyse. Moreover, it is a commonplace that only a portion of
    the data so labouriously collected is the subject of final analysis and
    publication. Secondary analysis is a well-established method in quantitative
    research and is raising its profile in application to qualitative data. It
    has a particular part to play when research is on sensitive topics and/or
    hard-to-reach populations, as in the example considered here. This article
    contributes to discussion of the potential and constraints of secondary
    analysis of qualitative data by reporting the outcome of the secondary
    analysis of a key study in the sociology of prison life, Cohen and Taylor's
    research on the long-term imprisonment of men in maximum security. The
    article re-visits Cohen and Taylor's original analysis and demonstrates
    support for an alternative, if complementary, conceptualisation, using
    archived data from the original study. Among the methodological issues
    discussed are the recovery of the context of the original fieldwork and the
    role of secondary analysis in an incremental approach to knowledge
    production.

    Long-term prisoners present correctional policy makers with for midable
    problems. These problems are rooted in the varied member ship of the
    population of long-term prisoners and in the seriousness of crimes for which
    these offenders are imprisoned. A new perspec tive for the administration of
    prison systems containing such inmates is offered. In terms of the loss
    associated with imprisonment, it is assumed that removal from society is
    perceived by most prisoners as the principal punishment inherent in
    incarceration. Since this pun ishment bears most heavily on long-term
    prisoners, special efforts must be made to ameliorate the secondary
    sanctions that accompany imprisonment.

- id: hulleyMoralWeightMurderforthcoming
  abstract: >-
    The act of murder ‘violates our basic humanity’ (Adobor 2022: 336) and
    raises deep moral questions about how and why a person could kill another
    human being. Yet little is known about how those who are implicated in a
    murder morally reflect on their actions. Existing literature focuses on the
    psychological excuses and justifications that people who have committed
    offences offer for their behaviour (e.g. Sykes and Matza 1957; see Maruna
    and Copes 2005 for full review). This paper contributes to a small but
    growing body of work that explores how individuals living in prison morally
    reflect on their offence and punishment (see, for example, Ievins 2023,
    Schinkel 2014, Jarman 2022). Drawing on interviews with men and women
    convicted of murder at a young age, who had been given long life sentences,
    this paper presents their moral reflections on the offence. Their narratives
    exposed the moral burden of being implicated in the killing of another human
    – a ‘moral weight’ that individuals carried, on a continuum from light to
    heavy. The relative weight of the burden was shaped by individuals’
    reflections on their own moral blameworthiness, the moral blameworthiness of
    the victim, and the comprehensibility of the offence within the context in
    which it occurred. The moral weight of the offence was associated with
    distinctive moral emotions ranging from regret (when ‘light’) to deep shame
    (when ‘heavy’). Reflecting on these findings, I argue two points: firstly,
    that people convicted of murder engage in the ‘normal’ process of moral
    reflection to try and make sense of the offence (Maruna and Copes 2005), and
    use conventional and culturally specific social constructions of murder to
    do so. But, this is easier for some than others. Secondly, being able to
    make sense of one’s behaviour in relation to the fatal act is protective, as
    it lightens the moral load of murder and enables individuals to ‘move on’
    with little psychotherapeutic intervention and with a less damaged sense of
    self, towards a positive future.

  abstract: >-
    Comparative penologists have described neoliberal and social democratic
    jurisdictions as though they exist at opposite ends of a continuum of
    inclusion and exclusion, and as though neoliberal states are inactive and
    social democratic states are invasive. This article, which is based on more
    than 129 interviews with men convicted of sex offenses in England & Wales
    and Norway, uses Cohen's work on inclusion and McNeill's typology of
    rehabilitative forms to complicate this simplistic binary. It argues that
    the punishment of men convicted of sex offenses in England & Wales was
    demanding but exclusionary; it imposed strict legal restrictions on these
    men during and after their imprisonment, blocking them from engaging in
    social and moral rehabilitation and providing a limited and treacherous
    route to change. In Norway, punishment operated in a way that was formally
    inclusionary but surprisingly laissez-faire: Prisoners retained their legal
    rights during and after their incarceration, but the lack of opportunities
    to discuss their offending meant that their sentences were rarely
    experienced as meaningful, and their formal inclusion was not enough for
    them to feel substantially included after release.

  abstract: >-
    Sex offenders constitute a significant proportion of the prison population -
    in England and Wales, almost one in six prisoners has been convicted of a
    sexual offence - and yet they barely feature in sociological studies of
    prison life. This article is based on research conducted in a medium
    security English prison which only accommodated sex offenders. It argues
    that if we are to understand prisoners' experiences of imprisonment and
    identity management, it is necessary to explore their horizontal
    relationships with other prisoners. Prisoners experienced their convictions
    as an assault on their moral character, resenting attempts to define them as
    sex offenders'. Following Sykes, we argue that prisoners attempted to form
    an accepting and equal moral community in order to mitigate the pain of this
    moral exclusion and to enable the development of a convivial atmosphere.
    However, these attempts were limited by imprisonment's structural
    limitations on trust and prisoners' imported negative feelings about sex
    offenders. This suggests that sex offenders may have more complex feelings
    towards their own moral exclusion than is suggested by their attempts to
    resist their own stigmatisation.

  type: article-journal
  volume: '17'

- id: ievinsPerfectlyIndividualizedConstantly2020
  abstract: >-
    Late-modern penal power has been described as ‘tight’. Through the
    increasing use of indeterminate sentences and psychological assessment, and
    the growing insistence that prisoners engage in self-government, the prison
    monitors and seeks to change those it holds. This tight and disciplinarian
    power is often described as contributing to the increasing fragmentation and
    atomisation of the prisoner community. However, this article, which is based
    on research conducted in a English medium-security prison for men convicted
    of sex offences, argues that tightness can operate through the prisoner
    community, in a process which it terms ‘lateral regulation’. It shows that
    prisoners spend a lot of time observing, categorising and policing their
    peers, in ways which replicate and often uphold the more formal systems of
    power. However, the relationship between these two systems of power is
    complex, and prisoners’ collective self-regulation can conflict with and
    challenge the demands of the penal institution, in a way which reveals some
    of the weaknesses in the institution’s disciplinary gaze, and indicates the
    normative motivations underlying this regulation.

    "Recent decades have seen a widespread effort to imprison more people for
    sexual violence. The Stains of Imprisonment offers an ethnographic account
    of one of the worlds that this push has created: an English prison for men
    convicted of sex offenses. This book examines the ways in which prisons are
    morally communicative institutions, instilling in prisoners particular ideas
    about the offenses they have committed-ideas that carry implications for
    prisoners' moral character. Investigating the moral messages contained in
    the prosaic yet power-imbued processes that make up daily life in custody,
    Ievins finds that the prison she studied communicated a pervasive sense of
    disgust and shame, marking the men it held as permanently stained. Rather
    than promoting accountability, this message discouraged prisoners from
    engaging in serious moral reflection on the harms they had caused. Analyzing
    these effects, Ievins explores the role that imprisonment plays as a
    response to sexual harm, and the extent to which it takes us closer to and
    further from justice"--

    Stateville penitentiary in Illinois has housed some of Chicago's most
    infamous criminals and was proclaimed to be ""the world's toughest prison""
    by Joseph Ragen, Stateville's powerful warden from 1936 to 1961. It shares
    with Attica, San Quentin, and Jackson the notoriety of being one of the
    maximum security prisons that has shaped the public's conception of
    imprisonment. In Stateville James B. Jacobs, a sociologist and legal
    scholar, presents the first historical examination of a total prison
    organization-administrators, guards, prisoners, and special interest groups.

    This PhD uses theoretical and conceptual resources from the anthropology of
    morality and ethics to explore moral communication in the contemporary life
    sentence, as seen through the ethical lives of men serving life sentences
    for murder. Empirically, it describes three things. First, moral
    communication *about murder*: what a conviction for this crime and the
    experience of imprisonment for life ‘said’ to prisoners about who they were
    and whom they ought to become. Second, moral communication *within a life
    course*: how people with different pre-prison experiences reacted to the
    rupture in identity imposed by the sanction. Third, moral communication
    *through the language of risk*: an unclear (though dominant) medium which
    imposed demands some lifers found a comfortable ‘fit’, but others did not.
    These descriptions draw on interview and documentary data relating to
    forty-eight individuals: thirty in a long-term category-B prison, and
    eighteen in a category-D or ‘open’ prison focused on resettlement. All
    serving mandatory life sentences for murder, they were otherwise a
    heterogeneous group: convicted in diverse circumstances, aged from their
    teens to their seventies, and sentenced between 1983 and 2017. Their minimum
    terms ranged in length from less than ten to thirty years, and they had
    served between 7% and 250% of these minimums. Both in their backgrounds and
    in their custodial experiences, then, they formed a broad and diverse
    sample, affording a wide range of perspectives on the theoretical and
    substantive questions addressed by the research. The PhD adds theoretical
    depth and empirical detail to a growing literature on experiences of
    long-term and life imprisonment. It also comments on some implications of
    this empirical material for how retributive penal theorists have understood
    the *aims* of punishment—in particular, whether long-term imprisonment
    succeeds in communicating to prisoners what is *wrong* (as opposed to merely
    *harmful*) about taking life. It argues, overall, that the mandatory life
    sentence as currently delivered is a morally incoherent sanction. On the one
    hand, it is too individualised to convey clear moral norms or to show
    meaningful solidarity with those harmed and wronged by murders. On the
    other, it is not individualised enough to communicate effectively with
    murderers about the ethical responses that their actions might warrant.

  abstract: >-
    Recent studies of long-term imprisonment describe a largely invariant
    pattern of prisoner adaptation. Using data from a qualitative study of men
    serving life sentences in England, I argue that adaptation may in fact vary
    more than these studies imply both because of the prisoner’s age when
    sentenced and because of the circumstances of particular offences.
    Participants’ engagement with the prison’s rehabilitative ‘offer’ depended
    on how the sentence affected their life course and what they understood to
    be the moral ramifications of the offence. These findings refine
    understanding of adaptation and suggest that a renewed focus on moral
    reflexivity may bear fruit in future prison research.

    This article examines the moral world of therapeutic penal communities
    through the lens of the experiences of men with sexual convictions and
    histories of sexual victimisation. Drawing on the concepts of lateral power
    and stigma, we discuss how Therapeutic Communities (TCs), which are
    intensely social communities, operate within three moral dimensions: the
    institutional set of therapeutic norms, the con code, and the broader
    sociocultural set of norms that intensely stigmatise sexual offending.
    Specifically, the focus of this article is how these norms shape the manner
    in which lateral power is used, navigated and resisted within TCs. We
    explore the manner in which TC processes are used as tools to enact lateral
    power over men with sexual offences, and how the three moral dimensions
    create a messy moral environment within the TC. Importantly, we explore how
    the residents navigate the morally complex dual identity of offender and
    victim. We also note that the moral messiness, and the conflicts between the
    moral dimensions, also raise challenges for how vertical institutional power
    is exercised. Finally, we point out that the neoliberal individualism
    inherent in today's sociocultural moral dimension further shapes how men
    with sexual offences experience the moral community of the TC.

  abstract: >-
    This ethnography of a prison treatment programme for sex offenders examines
    the meaning of rehabilitation in the context of the ‘new penology’. As it
    explores how cognitive–behaviourism structures treatment, it uncovers a
    therapeutics grounded in risk that actively constructs the identity of the
    sex offender. It shows how the management of risk relies on techniques of
    introspection and self-discipline—a patient's internalization of his crime
    cycle and relapse prevention plan—that target primarily sexual fantasies.
    These self-policing techniques radically transform the sex offender into a
    species entirely consumed by sex.

  abstract: >-
    A prison sentence is imbued with moral meaning about the offence which led
    to the punishment. However, based on interviews with prisoners serving
    typical sentences in England & Wales and Norway, we found that the offence
    was largely absent as a theme in staff-prisoner interactions during
    imprisonment. For some interviewees, the offence remained an
    absent-presence, which they tried to make sense of on their own, while
    others preferred to ‘get on with it’ and simply complete their sentence. We
    explore how the ‘absent-presence’ of the offence sometimes made punishment
    feel empty and meaningless, especially for prisoners who struggled to come
    to terms with their convictions. Drawing on the sociology of ‘nothing’ and
    the anthropology of ethics, we describe how the absent-presence of the
    offence can lead to confusion and misplaced shame, but at the same time
    foster positive relationships between the people who live and work in
    prisons.

    In this epilogue I suggest that this volume is a promising example of what I
    call ‘moral social scholarship’ (Liebling, in progress). It shows the extent
    to which our moral lives are real and can be studied empirically. Moral
    values show up whenever we study the human world closely and in
    person-centred ways, but they show up with particular starkness when we
    study places of confinement and dehumanisation.

  abstract: >-
    One out of every ten prisoners in the United States is serving a life
    sentence—roughly 130,000 people. While some have been sentenced to life in
    prison without parole, the majority of prisoners serving ‘life’ will be
    released back into society. But what becomes of those people who reenter the
    everyday world after serving life in prison?


    In After Life Imprisonment, Marieke Liem carefully examines the experiences
    of “lifers” upon release. Through interviews with over sixty homicide
    offenders sentenced to life but granted parole, Liem tracks those able to
    build a new life on the outside and those who were re-incarcerated. The
    interviews reveal prisoners’ reflections on being sentenced to life, as well
    as the challenges of employment, housing, and interpersonal relationships
    upon release. Liem explores the increase in handing out of life sentences,
    and specifically provides a basis for discussions of the goals, costs, and
    effects of long-term imprisonment, ultimately unpacking public policy and
    discourse surrounding long-term incarceration. A profound criminological
    examination, After Life Imprisonment reveals the untold, lived experiences
    of prisoners before and after their life sentences.

    This is a work of journalism as well as an essay on journalism. In two

    institutional psychoanalysis and Freudian biography. In this book, she
    examines the psychopathology of journalism. Using a strange and
    unprecedented lawsuit as her larger-than-life example--the lawsuit of
    Jeffrey MacDonald, a convicted murderer, against Joe McGinniss, the author
    of Fatal Vision, a book about the crime--she delves into the always uneasy,
    sometimes tragic relationship that exists between journalist and subject. In
    Malcolm's view, neither journalist nor subject can avoid the moral impasse
    that is built into the journalistic situation.--From publisher description

    This paper aims to advance the case for a more fully interdisciplinary
    understanding of offender rehabilitation, partly as a means of shedding
    light upon and moving beyond contemporary ‘paradigm conflicts’. It begins
    with a review of current arguments about what a credible ‘offender’
    rehabilitation theory requires and by exploring some aspects of current
    debates about different theories. It goes on to locate this specific kind of
    contemporary theory building in the context of historical arguments about
    and critiques of rehabilitation as a concept and in practice. In the third
    part of the paper, I explore the nature of the relationship between
    desistance theories and rehabilitation theories, so as to develop my
    concluding argument; that is, that debates about psychological
    rehabilitation have been hampered by a failure to engage fully with debates
    about at least three other forms of rehabilitation (legal, moral, and
    social) that emerge as being equally important in the process of desistance
    from crime.

- id: odonnellPrisonersSolitudeTime2014
  abstract: >-
    Prisoners, Solitude, and Time is an examination of two overlapping aspects
    of the prison experience that, despite their central importance, have not
    attracted the scholarly interest they deserve. The first of these is the
    degree to which prisoners can withstand the rigours of solitude. While the
    deleterious effects of penal isolation are well known, little systematic
    attention has been given to the factors associated with surviving, and even
    triumphing over, prolonged exposure to solitary confinement. The second is
    how prisoners experience the temporal dimension of their lives, in
    particular the ‘survival stratagems’ they deploy to reduce the potentially
    overwhelming prospect of a long, or even indefinite, period behind bars. The
    book focuses on an aspect of the prison experience—time, its meanderings,
    measures and meanings—that is seldom considered by academic commentators. It
    pays particular attention to the use of administrative segregation in what
    have become known as supermax prisons. The argument advanced in the book is
    built upon a wide range of prisoner narratives which are analysed in
    conjunction with academic critiques, official publications, personal
    communications, field visits, newspaper articles, administrative statistics,
    the reports of campaigning bodies, and other data. The book concludes with a
    series of reflections on hope, the search for meaning, post-traumatic
    growth, and the art of living.

    A small—scale survey of life—sentence prisoners was carried out to test
    hypotheses about the deteriorative effects of imprisonment based on
    Seligman's theories of learned helplessness. Instead, most prisoners were
    found to be able to cope with their new environment. Strategies of coping
    are illustrated from interviews with prisoners and analysis of reports
    contained in the prison files. the paper ends with a discussion of the
    'models of man' implicit in the different strands of the research and of the
    relevance of this prison survey to the study of life in the outside world.

    ”Little attention has been paid to the way in which criminal punishment is
    interpreted and narrated by offenders. This book uniquely addresses this
    area, examining the narratives of long-term prisoners with a special focus
    on the meaning they ascribe to their sentence, its impact on their lives and
    how it affects their inclination to offend in the future. Through a range of
    in-depth narrative interviews with male prisoners at different stages of
    their sentences, Schinkel considers their views on the legitimacy of their
    sentence, analysing what factors play a role in the shaping of these
    perspectives including life circumstances and the effects of rehabilitation.
    Exploring what purposes of punishment prisoners support and perceive as
    achieved by their sentence, the book argues that the need to survive the
    prison environment and the need to tell a progressive narrative outweighed
    the individual characteristics of each case, leading prisoners to accept
    their sentence even when they had cause to oppose it. Being Imprisoned
    offers new insights into how prisoners perceive their sentences and brings
    together issues of prison life, the moral performance of prisons, desistance
    and the purposes and legitimacy of criminal punishment”–

    This article takes a life-course perspective to the meaning of persistent
    short-term imprisonment and introduces the significance of ‘penal careers’.
    Examining a total of 62 interviews with men and women in Scotland with long
    careers of (progression through) criminal punishment, it uses to the concept
    of belonging as a lens to interpret their experiences. While some
    participants already felt early on in their career that they belonged in
    prison because of their shared characteristics with other prisoners, the
    repetition of imprisonment meant that they increasingly felt displaced from
    life outside and saw life in prison as ‘easier’ and ‘safer’. Nevertheless,
    looking back on their many sentences, they felt their cumulative meaning was
    ‘a waste of life’. The article concludes by considering steps towards
    tackling the conditions that create this sense of belonging in a place of
    punishment.

    OF FINDINGS Characteristics of the leader group. What are the determinants
    of leadership in a prison community? Comparison of our leaders with the
    total population suggests that, in general, factors related to criminal
    career and institutional adjustment are significantly associated with
    leadership, while social and economic background traits are not. Leaders, as
    a group, do not differ from the other inmates with respect to age,
    occupation, educational attainment, ethnic status, marital status, or scores
    on an intelligence test.'7 However, leaders have served more years in
    prison, have longer sentences remaining to be served, are more frequently
    charged with crimes of violence, and are more likely to be repeated
    offenders.18 Significantly more leaders tha other inmates are officially
    diagnosed as homosexual, psychoneurotic, or psychopathic.19 Finally, the
    institutional adjustments of leaders are marked by a significantly greater
    number of serious rule infractions, including escape, attempted escape,
    fighting, and assault.

  abstract: >-
    Corrections officials, prison staff and many people incarcerated have long
    believed that hope derived from a realistic possibility of release is
    essential to maintain order and safety in the prison. Criminological
    research consistently finds, however, that people without foreseeable or
    realistic prospects for release nevertheless do hope. Yet while findings of
    hope in criminological literature are robust, they remain undeveloped. This
    article draws from hope studies in other disciplines to advance a model of
    types of hope, which is then used to analyse evidence of hope in prior
    criminological literature on life sentences and long prison terms. The
    article distinguishes hopes derived from legal opportunities and escapist
    fantasies from deeper hopes grounded in despair, highlighting hope as a site
    for further research.

    Abstract Following a series of transformative political and legal battles,
    California's overcrowded prison system has moved in the direction of
    moderate decarceration. A softer stance on punishment means that thousands
    of previously ineligible inmates serving indeterminate sentences are now
    being considered for release on parole. Drawing on ethnographic observations
    of twenty parole hearings in one California men's prison, this study
    outlines how rehabilitation has come to be enmeshed in a logic of
    punitivity, as parole commissioners subject inmates to an individualizing
    gaze that misrecognizes the socially embedded nature of their performance.
    Parole commissioners are tasked with assessing dangerousness, deploying a
    multifaceted conception of risk that combines formalized actuarial
    instruments and evaluative judgments to form the inchoate and contradictory
    notion of ?insight.? Inmates are expected to demonstrate this if they are to
    be released, but what is insight? Parole boards assume that it is a valid
    indicator of future behavior and probable recidivism, and parole
    commissioners posit that successful inmates will be capable of demonstrating
    authentic remorse and insight, unimpeded by the constraints of an austere
    and dangerous carceral environment. However, the discretionary criteria
    established by the penal system are limited by the deleterious living
    conditions established by this same penal system.

  abstract: >-
    Many people think prisons are all the same-rows of cells filled with violent
    men who officials rule with an iron fist. Yet, life behind bars varies in
    incredible ways. In some facilities, prison officials govern with care and
    attention to prisoners' needs. In others, officials have remarkably little
    influence on the everyday life of prisoners, sometimes not even providing
    necessities like food and clean water. Why does prison social order around
    the world look so remarkably different? In The Puzzle of Prison Order, David
    Skarbek develops a theory of why prisons and prison life vary so much. He
    finds that how they're governed-sometimes by the state, and sometimes by the
    prisoners-matters the most. He investigates life in a wide array of
    prisons-in Brazil, Bolivia, Norway, a prisoner of war camp, England and
    Wales, women's prisons in California, and a gay and transgender housing unit
    in the Los Angeles County Jail-to understand the hierarchy of life on the
    inside. Drawing on economics and a vast empirical literature on legal
    systems, Skarbek offers a framework to not only understand why life on the
    inside varies in such fascinating and novel ways, but also how social order
    evolves and takes root behind bars.

  abstract: >-
    This book presents a substantial revolution on the character of confined
    social life. Drawing upon extensive fieldwork in two contrasting English
    maximum security prisons, the authors systematically compare their
    institutional order, including the differing control strategies deployed in
    each, as seen by both custodians and captives, controllers and controlled.
    The authors discuss the insinuations of their research for the tradition of
    sociological concern within the ‘prison community.’ They re-examine the
    resources of that rich but latterly somewhat dormant field in the light of
    some of the main currents in contemporary social theory, and thereby provide
    a new perspective on the ‘problem of order’ in maximum custody. This book
    will have significant policy implications, and it will be required reading
    for scholars and students in criminology and criminal justice, as well as
    for administrators and reformers in penal systems.

    Long sentenced young people are a small but significant part of the juvenile
    prison population. The current approach to young people convicted of serious
    crime speaks to wider issues in criminal and social justice, including the
    idealisation of (some) childhoods, processes of racialisation and identity
    and the sociology of the body. Analysing the relationships between
    biography, trauma and habitus reveals the ways in which class, racial and
    legal status are experienced and resisted.  Young Men's Experiences of
    Long-Term Imprisonment: Living Life considers the need for the
    reinvigoration of prison ethnography and calls for a phenomenological
    approach to understanding youth crime and punishment. An insightful
    ethnographic study on imprisoned 15- to 17-year-olds in England, this volume
    examines how young people experience long-term imprisonment, manage their
    time and imagine and shape their futures. Drawing on observations,
    interviews and correspondence, Tynan situates long-term imprisonment of
    young men within the wider social context of criminal and social justice;
    and analyses constructs and practices that locate responsibility for crime
    with individuals and communities.  Young Men's Experiences of Long-Term
    Imprisonment: Living Life will be of interest to students and researchers
    interested in the sociology of prisons, punishment and youth justice and
    qualitative research methodology.

  abstract: >-
    ‘Denial of the victim’ is one of the five classic techniques described by
    Sykes and Matza in their seminal work on techniques of neutralization. Based
    on ethnographic field work in a Norwegian remand prison, this article
    explores this particular technique as it is employed by prisoners in their
    narratives about how they came to be imprisoned. I will argue that this
    particular technique of neutralization, understood by Sykes and Matza as
    part of the etiology of crime, might fruitfully be re-conceptualized as a
    Foucauldian technique of the self tailored to the specific context of the
    prison. As both moral space and rehabilitation technology, a prison
    positions its prisoners as ‘immoral others’ who should confess and repent.
    This ascription of low morality may in fact be seen as one of the pains of
    imprisonment. Given this, victims represent problems for prisoners, as
    ‘having’ a victim equals being someone who has hurt another. I will show the
    narrative strategies prisoners employ when they reconstruct themselves as
    moral subjects in relation to their victims.

    In this article the author addresses two basic questions found at the
    intersection of ethics and qualitative research methodology:Why are some
    people reluctant to share their stories? and Are there some people whose
    stories ought not to be heard? Focusing on imprisoned sexual offenders, the
    author argues that the establishment of trust in the research relationship
    is essential to creating safe places for people living with “problem
    experiences” to tell their sto- ries. He also argues that however repugnant,
    the stories of society’s worst offenders must be heard if we as a society
    are to better understand their actions and protect ourselves.
