As a\n    result of this, desistance theory has not been used to evaluate the\n    administration of indeterminate sentences, meaning that\n    practitioners may be missing out on some of the insights that it can\n    generate. This qualitative study begins to fill that gap, using a\n    phenomenological analysis of eighteen in-depth semi-structured\n    interviews with life- sentenced prisoners at a single prison in\n    England, all of whom had been convicted of murder. It argues that\n    most eventually attempt conscious projects of personal change during\n    imprisonment; second, that many frame change in terms which are not\n    consistent with the official discourses of risk reduction (which\n    govern their progression through the sentence); and third, that how\n    they themselves conceive and pursue personal change is affected by\n    their position in the sentence and the life course, and also by the\n    specific nature and circumstances of their index offences. The\n    analysis classifies four different styles of agency found in the\n    sample: “defensive” and “fractured” agents were unwilling or unable\n    to accept responsibility for the offence, and were consequently in\n    penal “dead ends”; while “corrective” and “redemptive” agents had\n    encountered “turning points”, in that they accepted responsibility,\n    albeit in different ways. The analysis describes each group’s\n    characteristic ways of describing the offence and their part in it.\n    It also describes their attitudes to prison social life in general,\n    and to rehabilitative intervention in particular. The study as a\n    whole suggests that much of the personal change which lifers\n    themselves frame as significant happens outside rehabilitative\n    interventions, and may be invisible to key prison staff. This raises\n    important questions about whether prisons and prisoners think about\n    rehabilitation in the same way, with consequences for the legitimacy\n    of penal power.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJarman, B.

This is despite the fact that\n    since the late 1990s, safeguarding and child protection in places of\n    child custody have been significantly reformed and expanded in\n    scope. Under new regimes of safeguarding, policy compliance has\n    sometimes become the priority, with the effectiveness of\n    properly-applied policy not being questioned. In this context, new\n    and developing risks of abuse have gone unrecognised. Historical\n    research helps us to see how past safeguards, which had previously\n    been assumed to be effective, had in fact broken down. This usually\n    happened not only as the result of misconduct by “bad apples”.\n    Instead, the actions of “bad apples” usually occurred within\n    unhealthy institutional cultures in which staff used abusive methods\n    such as bullying and violence to secure legitimate outcomes such as\n    the maintenance of order. Such methods were often resorted to at\n    times of institutional pressure, for example during periods of\n    overcrowding or budgetary constraint. Those charged with managing\n    and monitoring conditions in youth custody often gave such methods\n    their tacit endorsement, evaluating them not in terms of individual\n    children’s welfare, but in terms of institutional priorities. In\n    such morally compromised climates, “bad apples” were able to pursue\n    wholly illegitimate and indefensible ends – such as the sexual abuse\n    and exploitation of children and young people – with impunity.\n    Understanding the cultural contexts of past abuse highlights the\n    dangers of complacency regarding today’s safeguarding policies.\n    Despite the more proactive safeguards implemented since 2000,\n    unhealthy occupational cultures – featuring confusion over\n    institutional goals, low staff morale, hierarchical management\n    structures, and institutional isolation – have not been eliminated\n    from the secure estate. The implication is that custodial\n    institutions for children are inherently risky environments,\n    particularly where they are not explicitly organised around an ethos\n    of care, or where wider organisational priorities (such as the need\n    for cost efficiencies) clash with that ethos. Youth custody\n    therefore must remain a minimal last resort, used where there is no\n    non-custodial alternative.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJarman, B. (2018, October 18).

    "text": "The life course\nI want now to sketch out a few brief descriptions of individuals who were at different points in the life course. I invite you to think about how the answers to these questions might differ for each person I describe.\n\nTimothy—also sentenced in mid-teens but given an exceptionally long tariff getting on for twice his age at conviction. Currently in the early sentence stages, struggling with a very high risk classification, which significantly constrains his life in prison and his contact with family. Angry about everything.\nSimeon—convicted in his mid-teens and given a tariff equivalent to about 80% of his age at the time. Progressed well, now nearly at the parole eligibility date, but has had a big setback after being caught with contraband, and he’s back in a higher-security prison.\nLeon—convicted in mid-twenties, and given a tariff longer than his age at the time. Now about halfway through. Has passed recommended offending behaviour courses with flying colours. Now wants to use the remaining half of the sentence to explore his educational potential and his creative and spiritual interests.\nEmlyn—convicted in mid-forties. Given tariff equivalent to roughly a fifth of his age at the time. But has served more than twice that. Sees his conviction as the result of an elaborate establishment conspiracy. Now in an open prison; frail, elderly and suspicious about staff, and with complex care needs which complicate planning for his release.\nMatt—convicted around age 50. Given another exceptionally long tariff taking him into his 80s. Admits the offence, thinks it was justified, and says he’s happy to take his punishment. Also says he’s enjoying his sentence, which he compares to ‘early retirement’. Unsure if he will live to be released.\n\nI think two things should be clear from even these few examples:\n\nfirst, that the stages of the adaptation process may vary depending on the age of the person—for example, for Matt there’s no distress even though he’s in the very early sentence stages\nsecond, by paying attention to what we might call people’s custodial careers, and to their changing ethical beliefs, we might see them adapting more than once to different demands: it’s not a one-off\n\nFor example, Emlyn and Simeon both had major setbacks during their sentence, which would have redrawn their expectations for the future, and their feelings about whether they were who they needed to be.\nTaking a step back and making comparisons of whole groups, a number of wider patterns in the sample become clear.\nPeople convicted when they are younger are generally much more inclined to root their ethics in a sense of becoming something else in future: they think there is a worthwhile life out there for them, they want to live it, and their time in prison, if used well, will help them prepare. I’ll say more later about what they think about offence-focused and risk-focused work, but the goals they described were pretty conventional: what most say they want is to work hard and have families—as this quote from Davidas suggests.\nWhat they want from the future is evident in the way they talk about prison social life: these men mostly know they lack formal qualifications, and in this quote Regis says he values his work for the fact that it develops his softer social skills, too.\nMeanwhile, Ebo (and many others) criticise the emphasis in prison workshops: as he says, what are you learning from that? I’ve been here six, seven years, and I’ve learnt nothing.\nThere were some men who had been convicted younger—particularly those with overwhelmingly long tariffs, or who were over tariff—who were less invested in the idea that the sentence was giving them skills for the future, but by and large this idea held for most of those convicted young.\nWe get a bit of a different picture from men convicted in mature adulthood. Generally their tariffs meant they might first be considered for parole not long before the state pension age. Nearly all had children already—many admitted to missing them badly—and most saw their likely post-prison destinations as low-income, precarious work (Gary). They were less sold on the idea that prison would prepare them for a better future, and common themes were staying as healthy as possible (as Leon suggests here), strategising how and where they might spend the remainder of the sentence, and—this was a really common theme—anticipating simple pleasures they couldn’t enjoy in prison. Many wanted to care for elderly parents and repay their loyalty. Many said they wanted to be outdoors and spend time in nature (I heard more than one detailed description of planned fishing and camping trips). And as Leon says here in this second quote, if your goals are quite simple like this, then there isn’t much to prepare for.\nBut another man, William, shows something very important that applies to everyone, regardless of age: imagining ethical goals, whether relaxed or ambitious, is largely dependent on reflexive space, and that comes from a basic level of ontological security in prison. William was indebted to drug dealers on a very rough prison wing. His family was not uniformly sympathetic and he wasn’t sure he could trust staff to keep him safe from creditors. When I met him he said he was really struggling to make the sentence meaningful, and that comes through in this quote.\nFinally, what of those sentenced when they were older? Here, the idea that adaptation involves reframing a different kind of future really breaks down. It seemed to me instead that these men derived their ethical self-image entirely from the past. They all had adult children, most had significant educational and career achievements, and they didn’t anticipate picking these up again after the sentence—if there was an ‘after the sentence’. Their lives before prison were not something irrelevant to leave behind and relinquish, but a well of experience useful for prison life. Matt, who I said described the sentence as being like ‘early retirement’, makes this point when comparing his attitude to the anger and dismay of younger men. Alf—the oldest man in the sample—says his prison time is helping him prepare for the future only in that it offers free gym membership. These men did not emphasise what they would become, but who they were. This is not to say they were always positive about themselves—John, for example, described how his adult children wanted nothing to do with him, and said this had led to the conclusion that he was a worse man than his father. But they used time in prison to reflect on and understand the lives they had already had, rather than imagining and preparing for new ones that they expected to have in the future."

    "text": "The nature of the offence\nSo that’s the life course. I also said I’d talk about how the offence itself features in lifers’ ethical lives. Most of what I’ve got to say here is based on the pilot study Jarman (2020) and I’m now only just revisiting this issue based on the PhD data, so what I’ve got to say here is more tentative than what I’ve said already about the life course. But I think the sample divides between people convicted of murder in different circumstances, and I think that divide has to do with the way in which particular convictions are experienced as particularly ‘staining’ (to borrow a concept from my colleague Alice Ievins 2017 p. 114). ‘Stain’ describes the extent to which prisoners feel morally and psychologically contaminated, and draws our attention to the ways in which imprisonment communicates a deliberate moral rejection of the prisoner by the wider community. I think if the men I interviewed felt ‘stained’ by their offences and their imprisonment, it’s also the case that some felt more indelibly stained than others.\nThose with what we could call ‘washable’ stain generally characterised the offence as a mistake, or as the result of bad influence or bad judgment. This made it something one could learn from. People convicted of such offences generally explained the circumstances of their lives at the time: the conflicts involved, the divided loyalties, impulsive decisions to follow what with hindsight was the wrong path, a sense of fate. The implication was this: “anyone, given those circumstances, could have done what I did”. This is basically a sociological explanation, and it implied that efforts at ethical change meant learning to avoid, resist or battle against one’s surroundings. That’s not easy in prison, but it is feasible, and can be meaningful.\nThis first quote from Regis is quite a good example. The ethical significance belongs to Regis’s lifestyle and his wrongly-ordered priorities, not on the sequence of events involved in the offence itself. Regis’s violence had been planned and part of a longer conflict with someone else, not situational and uncontrollable. His wider lifestyle, not the propensity to violence itself, was what he wanted to account for. Men like him were not always positive about rehabilitative provision but they accepted the general need to demonstrate change, and they took what they could: in this second quote Andy is scathing about some of his offending behaviour courses, but where the course fits patterns he recognises in his own life, he ‘won’t disrespect’ it. Ethically, Regis and Andy worked on their relationship with their surroundings. They saw bad influences in prison as a threat to them acquiring self-control and autonomy. If they were preoccupied by finding deeper psychological narratives to account for their violence, they didn’t say so in the interview.\nBy contrast, these deeper psychological narratives were much more noticeable among men who felt more indelibly ‘stained’ by their offence. The factors on the right suggested faults deeper within the self. Working up the from the bottom, unprovoked and uncontrolled violence raised the troubling possibility of a recurrence. Knowing the victim made it harder to compartmentalise and isolate the offence and prompted grief that wouldn’t elicit much sympathy in others. A vulnerable victim (especially if female) removed the legitimating tropes of violence between men who knew what they were getting into. Sexual motives and offences involving children—as victims or witnesses—were deeply discrediting. What these offences had in common was the absence of wider cultural narratives—as opposed to psychological narratives—within which they make sense. As a result, they were not simply experienced as blameworthy, but instead shameful.\nGary’s words in this quote give some impression of the alienation from self that these kinds of offences could lead to, and though he was unusual both in using the term evil about himself, and in describing himself as a ‘murderer’, it seemed to me he was expressing fear, not pride, when he did this. This group was also more likely to have participated in high-intensity interventions such as long-term therapy, and their accounts of the offence were much more like this one from Nicholas: very preoccupied with early life, psychological development and trauma, and very publicly identified with the wrongs they had done. These men were more likely to identify with the idea that they were lastingly risky and in doing so they disclosed more of themselves, including sometimes disclosing additional offences they had not been convicted of. But these disclosures often carried lasting consequences, reproducing a classification as ‘dangerous’, as this quote from Derek suggests. He said that what he disclosed on a course had become the subject of gossip among other prisoners, following him around the system and leading to new accusations in new prisons which, his files suggested, had added to concerns about the risks involved in his release. He was in prison more than twenty years over tariff, and had been in prison since I was a toddler.\nThis is an example of prisoners policing the behaviour of peers they believe to be sex offenders, echoing the findings of Alice Ievins (2020 p. 6). It shows how risk classification can signal an individual’s in-prison conduct to be more blameable, altering their experience of punishment and not merely on the basis of the original offence. This chimes strongly with a recent paper by Robert Werth (2019 p. 327), writing about his ethnographic research in a parole office in California. Werth theorises the effects of penal risk technologies, arguing that they “do not so much describe reality” as they “constitute, structure and alter what they appear to report on”."

Empirically,\n    it describes three things. First, moral communication *about\n    murder*: what a conviction for this crime and the experience of\n    imprisonment for life “said” to prisoners about who they were and\n    whom they ought to become. Second, moral communication *within a\n    life course*: how people with different pre-prison experiences\n    reacted to the rupture in identity imposed by the sanction.

    "text": "Rapid adjustment in the early sentence stages\nThe six men in the ‘very early’ and ‘early’ stages of the sentence (four of whom were in prison for the first time) alluded to experiences of ‘entry shock’. However, they did so in terms suggesting neither the ‘catastrophic’ loss of selfhood evident among people sentenced when much older (Crawley & Sparks 2006), nor the expressive, resistant, or dissociative behaviour characteristic of younger people experiencing grief for their extra-carceral lives during the early sentence stages.4 None described any involvement in violence in prison, whether it was acted out on the self or on others. Only one disclosed recent drug use.\nTheir accounts of the legal process and of the conviction itself differed strikingly from the emphatic picture of ‘despair and disbelief’ and ‘temporary moral suspension’ found by Crewe et al. (2020) among their younger sample. A few in the present subsample had pleaded guilty while most had gone to trial, but only one made a strong claim of innocence.5 In some cases, moral guilt ran deep, as Gary explained:6\n\nI hate myself for it. And [I] still think, ‘Hang me, or needle, or whatever they want to do’. Because I still feel they should have took my life because I took his life.\n\nOther self-evaluations were more qualified than this, but accepted that involvement in killing another person deserved punishment:\n\nI honestly didn’t mean to do it, but you can’t say that, can you? I didn’t plan it, but he’s dead and I did it. I weren’t gonna waste a jury’s time. It’s taking the piss, isn’t it? Come on, you’ve taken someone’s life and you’re trying to get away with it? It’s not right. (Ron)7\nIt should have been manslaughter, but I’m not going to keep moaning about it. (Robert)\n\nThe underlying sentiment in the last two quotes was widespread: the sentence was there to be got on with. If they complained, most did so about aspects of prison life, not the sentence itself. They apparently felt little of the despair and ‘temporal vertigo’ of younger lifers but were able to conceptualise what were still very long sentences by drawing on their own biographies (Crewe et al. 2020). They accepted their convictions, or at least were resigned to them. In this, they resembled Crewe’s (Crewe 2009 p. 170) short- to medium-sentenced ‘pragmatists’, in that most appeared ‘not [to] dwell on their moral status or the legitimacy of their predicament’, but instead simply got on with the sentence."

    "text": "Strategising progression\nThough many in the subsample had some difficult experiences in the early sentence stages (e.g. being robbed or bullied), they tended eventually to recognise that their non-involvement in prison subcultures could facilitate their progression (by minimising the trouble they might get into):\n\nI never done drugs anyway, but I know people that are [and] they know I’m not interested so they won’t […] try and drag me into it. (Gary)\n\nThey saw category-B prisons as tolerable if unpleasant environments, prizing their single cells, self-cook facilities, and relatively varied work opportunities. Dialling back their material desires, they reflected that they could be enduring worse hardships:\n\nMe and my mate [were] sitting there laughing… How are these dickheads suffering? We’ve been in a couple of years, and we’re sorted! You know? Got everything we want. [These other fellas are] young, short-sighted idiots, you know? Haven’t got the life experience, haven’t got, you know, that attitude… (Matt)\n\nSeveral in the in long-term category-B prisons said they were consciously trying to delay ‘progressive’ moves:\n\nA lot of us don’t actually want to do courses to get onto C-cat, we want to get D-cat. We are in no rush. We want to try and bypass the whole C-cat scenario. (Pete)\n\nPete and others preferred to stay where they were for as long as possible, and one (Alan) who had earned his cat-C very early in the sentence said he was ‘livid’ about it. Confronting the offence and rehearsing a narrative of ‘change’ was not often a priority for those with years of their tariff left to serve. They felt little pressure to be more proactive. Category-B regimes afforded them (relatively) more comfortable accommodation and a more conducive regime than they anticipated in ‘chaotic’ (Pete) category-C prisons. Meanwhile, the same regimes actively supported their view of themselves as morally worthy agents, by requiring simply that they work (which they did willingly and often in coveted roles) and comply (which they did easily)."

    "section": "Defending moral status and questioning risk",
    "text": "Defending moral status and questioning risk\nThe men had contrasting attitudes to risk, change, and progression, falling into two broad ideal-type groups. These are summarised in Table 2 (below). Both groups brought their substantial life experience before prison into play when discussing how their conviction had affected their self-identity, but they emphasised different aspects of those experiences. One group, whose public attitude to the offence was broadly to minimise it as a ‘mistake’, highlighted aspects of their lives which were mostly irrelevant to their offending, but which suggested their ‘real’ moral status as good, if flawed, people. Another group, whose public attitude to the offence more openly dwelled on guilt, shame, regret, or remorse, pointed to patterns of behaviour in their past lives which, in their view, had eventually culminated in the offence. Both attitudes situated the speaker as a morally decent person, but they differed in how far they acknowledged the offence as morally relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1 – ‘the mistaken’\nGroup 2 – ‘the remorseful’\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the offence\nAn aberration, discontinuous with the ‘true self’ at the time\nA culmination, continuous with the ‘true self’ at the time\n\n\nOrigin of violence\nProvocative situations or people, personal mistakes\nA self capable of being provoked, personal faults\n\n\nEthical priority in prison\nSelf-preservation\nSelf-development\n\n\nAttitude to risk\nAlienation, ‘their label’\nRecognition, ‘my problem’\n\n\nAttitude to offence-focused work\nResented as vindictive\nAccepted as legitimate\n\n\n\nTable 2: Attitudes to risk, change and progression\nThese ideal types resemble those summarised by other researchers, including the ‘good person who made a mistake’ and ‘bad person who became good’ narratives highlighted among young lifers, and the ‘stability’, ‘return’, and ‘elastic’ narratives noted by Lois Presser among violent men (See Crewe et al. 2020; also, Presser 2004).\nIn describing their attitudes to rehabilitative intervention, older lifers in Group 1 (who made up around two-thirds of the subsample) took refuge in their lives before conviction, offering past experiences and achievements as counterweights against official assessments of their risk and culpability as murderers. Such assertions of moral status made the murder conviction marginal to their story, and questioned the corresponding implication that they ought to reform themselves, as Gerald indicated:\n\nI was never wilful, never rebellious. I might have been naïve. I always thought well of people generally. I was following the rules generally. I brought up a very good family. I had a very good job. You know, a respectful [sic] job […] There’s nowhere I can really go [in prison], to be honest with you […] I do a good job. I do my work. Where can I go? (Gerald)\n\nThey frequently emphasised their moral superiority to other prisoners, but these comparisons were seldom relevant to their index offence(s), nor to a meaningful understanding of risk. Robert exemplified the narrative balancing act this involved. He declared he had ‘no respect for cons’ but had nonetheless been ‘an arsehole’ before prison. He declared, ‘if I was a judge, I would have been harder on me than he was’. But he emphasised that his ‘wild’ lifestyle had been paid for by lawful earnings and wealth. Paradoxically, he judged himself more harshly for his past conduct in intimate relationships than for murdering the victim (‘a cunt’) whose provocations Robert said had caused the offence. The conviction had not erased his sense of social status in relation to other prisoners (who he derided as ‘scum’). Others were readier to admit to feelings of remorse, but crucially not to profess these publicly: Gerald, for example, insisted they were a matter between him and God.\nFor Group 1, the conviction and sentence were neither a ‘catastrophe’ (Crawley & Sparks 2005), nor a radical rupture between past, present and future (Crewe et al. 2020). Life before prison remained a significant discursive resource, not an overwhelmingly painful absence. Memories of it, and comparisons with other (mostly younger) prisoners, reassured these men that they were not the ‘real’ criminals. It followed that most questioned the idea that they had reformative work to do, by reducing risk or changing their characters. Their scepticism about risk reduction, at least, was not groundless: ten men in the subsample had ‘low’ actuarial risk scores across the board8 and none scored ‘high’. In Risk of Serious Harm assessments, only one posed more than a ‘low’ risk to any group in custody, although all fifteen were expected to pose at least a ‘medium’ risk to at least one group in the community.9\nOf course, assessments of risk and evaluations of culpability and moral worth are analytically distinct. But just as risk assessors sometimes do (Slovic & Peters 2006), Group 1 often conflated moral/legal culpability with statistical risk, something that the prison encouraged by targeting its offence-focused interventions so rigorously at those posing higher risk.10 Much of their ethical work buttressed their self-worth against the stigma implied by the conviction. Questions about risk in their interviews sometimes prompted them to revisit questions of culpability in the index offence:\n\nThey keep referring to risk, you see? I might kill somebody else any minute! Stupid fools! It’s just lack of knowledge, lack of understanding. You see […] all these people making decisions never talk to anybody in my family, who know all about [the circumstances] (Alf)\n\nThe emphasis here was on the singular nature of the offence, framed as an aberration, irrelevant to future behaviour. While not disputing legal guilt, Alf situated it in his longstanding frustrations with the person he had killed. Implicitly, the resort to lethal violence did not blemish his character, and his age gave him more experiences of conventional social status through work and family life than was available to younger people, who offered similar narratives with less discursive ballast.11\nTo Group 1, others who displayed ‘appalling’ (Gerald) conduct in prison seemed to be the ‘real’ criminals (and far ‘riskier’). Group 1 framed their index offences as discontinuous with patterns in their longer-term behaviour. They were compliant and ‘low risk’, and therefore also a low priority for intervention, so they were hardly pushed to search for such patterns. Their claim, then, was not that murder had been justified, nor exactly that they were not responsible, but that it did not morally contaminate them. Thus, it seemed to them, they required no rehabilitation. The offence had been a mistake, they already knew right from wrong, and stoic endurance of the penalty—‘suck[ing] it up’ (Robert)—was the extent of the moral obligation that punishment imposed.\nGroup 2, by contrast, were far readier to see the offence as part of a pattern. Comprising around a third of the subsample, they usually possessed few or no prior convictions but explicitly located the offence within a longer pattern of behaviour. Their descriptions of themselves strongly diverged from those quoted above:\n\nI feel that I am evil […] I didn’t want to take his life, but… I stabbed him […] I couldn’t stop. That’s all I remember. I just couldn’t stop. It wouldn’t let me […] Anger sort of takes me away from myself. (Gary)\n\nGary’s offence had caused him experiences of dissociation and self-alienation. His ethical work targeted a long-standing pattern of alcohol-fuelled violence. For Alan, the long-term behavioural pattern involved conflict in intimate relationships:\n\nBells were rung in other relationships where [partners] said […] ‘You need to get help’. [I was] very stubborn, and thinking, ‘well, there’s nothing wrong with me, why do [they] keep saying that?’ […] And that’s why I wanted to do [the Kaizen course].\nBJ: What did it offer you?\nMaking me a better person.\n\nAcknowledging flaws in the self usually meant trying to correct them, but not always: Terry said he was too old to change. His beliefs and attitudes about violence were rigid, but he pointed to age and failing health as evidence of reduced risk:\n\nIf I looked in the mirror and thought, “twenty years ago you would have done [i.e. assaulted] that geezer…” You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do […] [But] if I have an argument now […] I go all faint, I can’t get my breath. It’s terrible […] if someone says something, I still can’t help giving it back […] Even though I know I can’t back it up no more. (Terry)"

    "text": "Theme 1: History and trends in sentencing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme and question covered\n\n\n\n1: What have been the key drivers in changes in sentencing, and how have these changes met the statutory purposes of sentencing?\n\n\n\nKey points and recommendations\nThis section demonstrates that the current prison capacity crisis emerges from the interaction of multiple long-term pressures affecting both “front door” sentencing and “back door” progression arrangements. Based on historical trends and current challenges, I recommend that the Review:\n\nConsider both sentence allocation (“front door” sentencing) and sentence administration (“back door” sentencing) in developing solutions;\nInclude longer-sentenced prisoners within scope, as both immediate capacity pressures and longer-term systemic challenges affect this group; and\nAddress progression arrangements for those already in the system, alongside measures affecting new receptions.\n\nThese recommendations are based on the following evidence and analysis.\n\nEvidence: Three phases of prison population growth\nThe section presents evidence that the principal long-term drivers of prison population growth can be understood by thinking of prison population growth since the 1990s as a story with three distinct phases:\n1990s-c.2010: court-driven growth\n\nIncreased flow of cases through courts drove population growth\nAverage sentence lengths grew slightly\nPrison capacity expanded to barely keep pace\n\nc.2010-2019: sentence length-driven growth\n\nCase flow decreased but longer sentences maintained population\nRecall numbers steadily increased\nCapacity remained steady with some new-for-old replacement\n\n2019-present: multiple systemic pressures\n\nSharp increases in recalls and remand population\nCovid-19 temporarily masked underlying pressures\nCurrent crisis emerges from combined effects\n\n\n\nAnalysis: Systemic pressures on progression\nHaving characterised the population growth of recent decades, the section analyses how the allocation and administration of long sentences for serious offences has been a key long-term driver of capacity pressures. The analysis identifies an interplay between four factors:\n\nSentence inflation has particularly affected those serving sentences for serious offences;\nIncreased use of recall creates additional barriers to effective progression;\nGrowth in the remand population adds operational pressures affecting all prisoners; and\nProgression pathways become unclear or inconsistent for many.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nThe section argues that since these factors relate both to the allocation and to the administration of sentences, neither emergency early release measures nor reduced court backlogs alone will fully address them. The Review must consider both ends of the sentencing process if it is to identify long-term, sustainable solutions, and this is the foundation for the recommendations presented at the start of this summary.\nThe remainder of this section examines these points in greater detail, providing fuller evidence and analysis for each element of the summary above.\n\n\n\nDetailed response: the long-term drivers of capacity pressures\n\nLong-term drivers of population growth\nThe Review’s call for evidence rightly links the current prison capacity crisis with its long-term cause, sentence inflation. This is a welcome development. This section of the response describes how the current situation has developed. As the Ministry of Justice’s own analysis [3] (pp. 4–12). makes clear, there have been three major long-term drivers of prison population growth:\n\nA sentenced prison population increasingly composed of people serving sentences for offences involving physical and sexual violence;\nAn across-the board increase in the average length of sentences imposed for all offences; but with particular reference to the group of serious offenders mentioned in the previous point,\nAn increasing number of sentences involving both an uncertain release date and a period of risk-assessed and conditional release, from which the prisoner may be recalled to custody.\n\n\n\nThree phases of growth since the 1990s\nAn analysis by the Institute for Government [4] adds useful nuance to this picture, by dividing the narrative into three distinct periods. It finds that between the mid-1990s and around 2010, the growth of the sentenced population was driven mainly by increases in the numbers of cases being handled by the courts, though average sentence lengths grew slightly at the same time. Prison capacity expanded during this period, barely keeping pace. Then, from around 2010 until around 2019, the flow of cases ebbed, but increased average sentence lengths and (eventually) a steady increase in recall numbers combined to keep the prison population stable, despite fewer convictions. Capacity overall remained steady, with some new-for-old replacement of closed prisons. For most of the 2010s, the population stayed broadly stable, too, albeit with a growing recall component. Finally, from around 2019, rapid increases in the number of recalls, and in the remand population, exacerbated matters. The resulting pressure abated somewhat due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which closed the courts and halted convictions, but has become acute following the pandemic.\nThis analysis reveals how the current crisis emerges from the interaction of multiple systemic pressures, rather than from any single policy decision or trend. The combination of longer sentences, increased use of recall, and growth in the remand population have created particular challenges for the progression of longer-sentenced prisoners through the system. These pressures are especially acute for those serving sentences for serious offences, who often face unclear or inconsistent progression pathways. Understanding this context is crucial for developing reform proposals that address both immediate capacity pressures and longer-term structural challenges.\n\n\nCurrent pressures on progression and release\nIncreases in the recall and remand populations are, partly, a function of pressures on the probation and courts services. These pressures have been a significant factor in the growth of the remand and recall populations, remain unresolved, and must be factored into any action aiming to reduce pressure on prison capacity.\nThere is evidence [e.g. 5–6] that some prisoners serving long and indeterminate sentences feel unclear about how they are to progress through the system. Many engage unevenly, intermittently, or not at all with the expectation to address their offending behaviour and reduce their risk. Some serving longer and indeterminate sentences say that they feel as if the prison “leaves them to it”, making few explicit demands in relation to the sentence plan until they are some distance into the sentence, and thereby, in effect, warehousing them for at least some of it.\nThis issue of sentence progression is addressed more fully under theme 6; the point here is that if long-term prisoners do not feel able to address their risk and progress, then this will add to population pressures, since their sentences delay their release if they are unwilling or unable to earn their release and reintegration.\n\n\nPolicy implications\nThe evidence presented above suggests three key considerations for policy reform.\nFirst, any sustainable solution to current capacity pressures must address both the “front door” of sentencing and the “back door” [1] of progression and release mechanisms. Focusing solely on reducing new receptions, without addressing progression pathways for those already in the system, is unlikely to yield sustainable reductions in the prison population.\nSecond, progression arrangements for longer-sentenced prisoners require particular attention. This group has become an increasingly significant proportion of the prison population, yet progression pathways for them often remain unclear or inconsistent. Reform of these pathways could yield benefits both for prison capacity and for sentence effectiveness.\nThird, the relationship between sentence length and progression needs systematic review. Longer sentences do not automatically translate into more effective rehabilitation or public protection, particularly when progression pathways are unclear or poorly structured. Potentially, reform of progression arrangements would improve both system efficiency and sentence effectiveness.\nThese considerations support the case for structured progression reform, particularly for those serving longer sentences. Such reform should aim to create clearer, more consistent progression pathways while maintaining appropriate public protection measures. This approach would address both immediate capacity pressures and longer-term systemic challenges identified in the historical analysis.\n\n\nImplications for the review: considering both “front” and “back” door sentencing\nThe policy implications outlined above indicate that the Review must consider both “front” and “back” door sentencing [1] in developing its recommendations. This dual focus is particularly important given the evidence that both sentence allocation and sentence administration can contribute to prison population pressure. Neither short-term measures affecting sentence allocation, nor administrative changes to progression arrangements alone, will be sufficient to address the systemic pressures identified in the historical analysis.\nNeither 2024’s emergency early release measures (which brought forward the automatic release point for some serving determinate sentences), nor a reduction in the courts backlog (which will lower the remand numbers but increase the sentenced population), will address these long-term factors.\nIt follows that a review seeking long-term solutions should make recommendations in relation to both the allocation of sentences by sentencing courts at the “front” door, and the administrative progression and release measures which comprise the “back” door. Moreover, because the sentencing of serious cases has been the consistent long-term driver of prison population growth, my recommendation would be that the Review should not exclude this group from its consideration. It should certainly make recommendations in relation to “less dangerous” offenders serving shorter, and often determinate, sentences, but should also examine the sentencing of more serious offenders.\nHaving established that both “front” and “back” door sentencing require attention, including for serious offences, we must consider how public opinion shapes the political feasibility of reform in this area."

    "text": "Theme 2: Structures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme and question covered\n\n\n\n2: How might we reform structures and processes to better meet the purposes of sentencing whilst ensuring a sustainable system?\n\n\n\nKey points and recommendations\nThis section examines how public opinion influences sentencing policy and institutions. Drawing on recent polling and academic research, it shows that public views on sentencing are more complex and potentially less punitive than often assumed. Based on this evidence, I believe that the Review should adopt recommendations made by a 2022 Independent Commission chaired by Bishop James Jones [2], including:\n\nThe establishment of a citizens’ assembly to enable informed public deliberation about sentencing for serious offences;\nReform mechanisms to incorporate public views into sentencing policy to better reflect the nuanced reality of public opinion;\nwhich recommended improved communication with victims about sentence progression.\n\nThese recommendations emerge from evidence showing that public opinion on sentencing is:\n\nOften poorly informed about current practice\nResponsive to detailed information about specific cases\nLess consistently punitive than commonly assumed\nUnstable over time, even within individuals\nMost effectively engaged through deliberative processes\n\n\nEvidence: Understanding public opinion\nRecent research reveals important patterns in how the public understands and engages with sentencing. Opinion polling indicates that public understanding is limited in several key areas:\nMost members of the public:\n\nOverestimate crime rates, particularly for serious violent offending\nUnderestimate the severity of sentences handed down\nIncorrectly believe sentences have grown shorter\nKnow little about prison conditions yet hold strong views about them\nSupport tougher penalties when considering offences in the abstract\nFavor less punitive approaches when given detailed case information\n\nUniquely, recent international research examining the stability of citizens’ views on punishment over time suggests that preferences often vary considerably, even within the same person, regarding:\n\nHow different offences should be ranked by seriousness\nWhat kinds of penalty are appropriate\nWhat quantities of punishment are appropriate\n\nThis evidence suggests that public opinion on sentencing cannot be assumed to be either consistently punitive or stable over time. Instead, views tend to be:\n\nMore nuanced when better informed\nResponsive to specific case details\nVariable depending on context\nFocused on public protection more than punishment\n\n\n\nAnalysis: Current institutional responses\nThe current institutional framework for incorporating public views into sentencing policy faces several challenges.\nFirst, public campaigns often create pressure for increased severity. This pressure may be vented in different ways, for instance:\n\nDemands for higher starting points in sentencing guidelines\nMore restrictive release decision-making\nEnhanced risk controls\n\nSecond, these campaigns, while legitimate expressions of public concern, may:\n\nAmplify more punitive voices\nCreate political pressure that is difficult to resist\nLead to unbalanced policy responses\nUndermine systematic policy development\n\nThird, existing consultation mechanisms may not effectively capture the complexity of countervailing views, nor enable the kind of informed deliberation that research suggests can lead to more nuanced policy preferences. The result is to contribute to a kind of ratchet whereby it is difficult to turn the clock back on penal excess.\n\n\nLooking ahead\nThis analysis suggests three broad directions for sentencing reform:\nEnhanced public deliberation\n\nCitizens’ assembly on sentencing of serious offences\nBetter information about how sentences operate\nRegular collection of evidence about public attitudes\n\nReformed institutional processes\n\nClearer frameworks for weighing public views\nBetter integration of evidence about public attitudes\nProactive attempts to engage with the full range of public opinion\n\nImproved communication\n\nBetter explanation of sentencing decisions\nEnhanced victim liaison arrangements\nClearer public information about progression\n\nThe recommendations of the 2022 Jones review offer a practical blueprint for implementing these reforms in relation to long sentences, while maintaining democratic accountability and public confidence.\nThe remainder of this section examines these points in greater detail, providing fuller evidence and analysis for each element of the argument presented above.\n\n\n\nDetailed response: public opinion and sentencing policy\nTo understand how public views might better inform sentencing reform, we must first examine how public opinion currently influences policy. The Review’s call for evidence invites reflection on the structures and processes that contribute to sentencing, naming institutions including the Government, Parliament, the Sentencing Council, the judiciary and the courts, and the Attorney General.\nIt was striking to me that the call for evidence made relatively few references to “the public”, in whose name alone punishments imposed by a democratic state may claim their legitimacy. Nearly all of these references to “the public” relate to public protection—unsurprisingly, considering that this is a specific sentencing aim. There is one reference in the call for evidence to public confidence in sentences, when the call’s introduction of theme 3 invites respondents to reflect on how technology may be used to make community sentences more “robust”. Under this theme, number 2 (“structures”), however, there is just one oblique reference to the public, when the call invites respondents to “consider […] how external campaigns influence policy”.\nThese references imply, subtly, that “the public” may be assumed to favour sentences which i) protect them against crime, and which ii) are “tough” and punitive. In fact, however, public opinion on sentencing is complex and nuanced. Only the first assumption finds strong and unambiguous support from the available evidence. Yet the Review’s call for evidence makes few references to public opinion, more broadly, about the aims of sentencing, which seems to me like an omission.\n\nPublic understanding of sentencing\nA key factor in public opinion research is how well-informed respondents are. Opinion polling indicates that public understanding of sentencing and of the criminal justice system is limited, and does not recognise the recent direction of travel. For example:\n\nMost members of the public overestimate crime rates, including rates of serious violent offending, and believe (incorrectly) that they have risen over the long term [7];\nAn overwhelming majority underestimate the severity of sentences handed down, including for serious offences [7];\nA majority believe (incorrectly) that sentences, on average, have grown shorter [7];\nA majority believe (incorrectly) that prisoners released after longer sentences are more likely to reoffend [8];\nJust under half believe that prison conditions are too “easy” on prisoners, but over three quarters also say that they know “not very much” or “nothing at all” about prisons [8].\n\n\n\nHow information affects public views\nSimilarly, the degree to which public opinion is informed tends to affect the penal aims it endorses. Members of the public are more likely to support “tougher” penalties when they consider what punishment is appropriate for a given offence in the abstract [9]. They are also less likely to support “tough” sanctions when they are asked to select a penalty in the same way which sentencers must: with relevant information at hand about the circumstances of the offence [9].\nFinally, even allowing for these distinctions about how well-informed opinion may be, when asked (in the abstract) to consider the purposes of even the most ostensibly punitive sentence (imprisonment), the public may not actually consider that punishment is the most important aim. Specifically, polling respondents invited to select the most important reason to impose a prison sentence were most likely to select “protecting the public by removing offenders from society” (chosen by 42%). The purpose next most likely to be selected as “most important” was rehabilitation (chosen by 19%), though over half of respondents did not believe that prisons were delivering that aim effectively [8].\n\n\nThe (in)stability of public opinion\nOn this basis, two things seem clear about UK public opinion on sentencing. First, it cannot automatically be assumed to be punitive (in the sense of wanting “tough” penalties to the exclusion of other goals), even when considering the reasons to send someone to prison. Second, there is considerable diversity of opinion between individuals.\nTo these findings can be added a recently published international study, which (uniquely, as far as I am aware) gauges the stability over time of the same individuals’ preferences about punishment. Based on a representative sample of over 11,000 individuals polled in six central European countries [9], the research shows how respondents’ views often varied considerably over time, on a range of questions including how different offences should be ranked in order of seriousness; what kinds of penalty are appropriate for these offences;,5 and what quantities (i.e. durations) of punishment are appropriate for these offences.\nIn other words, a preference for “tough” or “lenient” sentencing is often not stable over time, even within the same individual, and sentencing preferences may be responsive to extraneous factors, such as the respondent’s mood. This, the authors of the study suggest, favours an approach to penalty-setting which takes public opinion on punishment as a “valued beginning”, but does not treat it as the only relevant consideration [9] (p. 14), particularly when it comes to issues of principle with rights implications, such as how to determine the upper limits.\nThis research does not relate to UK public opinion, which (it has often been argued) is typically more punitive than in comparable European countries. But the findings are consistent across the six countries covered by the polling.6 There is no obvious reason to suppose that the UK public would depart from this pattern.\n\n\nThe role of public campaigns\nThe review invites respondents to reflect on the role played by “external campaigns” in driving up sentencing severity.\nPublic opinion may manifest itself most visibly and most pressingly to policymakers in the form of such campaigns, which often demand “tougher” sentencing, either at the ’front’ door (in the form of increased penalties), or at the “back” door (in the form of more restrictive release decision-making, and/or more stringent risk controls).\nIn the first category, various campaigns since the 2003 Criminal Justice Act have resulted in new mandatory “starting points” for different kinds of murder, mostly through amendments to Schedule 21 of that legislation. The Act had already ensured that murder sentencing would become drastically more severe, more or less doubling the starting points which were applied to some kinds of murder before it became law. Since them, the sentencing of homicide has seen numerous changes.\nIn 2008. a whole-life order starting point was added for murders motivated by the desire to advance a racial cause. In 2010, a 25-year starting point was introduced for murders where the offender brought a knife to the scene. In 2012. a 30-year starting point was introduced for murders aggravated by hatred based on disability or transgender identity. In 2015, a whole-life order starting point was introduced for the murder of a police or prison officer killed in the course of their duties. And in 2022. a mandatory life sentence was introduced for any person killing an emergency service worker while in the course of committing another crime, including if a jury determines the homicide to have been manslaughter, not murder.\nI have described these changes because homicide sentencing is the area I am most familiar with. The number of offenders affected in most of these cases7 is very small, and there is a good chance that sentencers in each case might independently have selected a sentence just as severe as those which are now statutory requirements. Even so, I believe similar public campaigns for stiffer penalties have also operated with less serious offences than homicide, and other responses to this call for evidence might highlight examples.\nOther campaigns by or on behalf of crime victims have focused not on the initial penalty for the offence, but on prison release. Since the statutory release test for parole sentences is clearly and unambiguously a risk assessment, the retrospective considerations which often frame public debate about these campaigns (for instance, whether the prisoner has been “punished enough”, how aggravated was the original offence, and whether release is “deserved”) are out of scope; only considerations of risk are relevant.8 Yet the campaigns often carry considerable public support, which in turn may see arguments about risk as technicalities, missing what is perceived to be the real point of the campaign.\nIn short, campaigns can relate either to the allocation of the sentence, or its administration (particularly in relation to release). In each case, what is more significant (for current purposes) than the merits or results of any individual campaign is the underlying pattern of change which has by now become well established. It resembles a ratchet: if sentences do become more severe at the front or back door, then it will be politically difficult to wind the clock back.\nThis is, largely, because of how public opinion presents itself to decision-makers through campaigns. To ignore or deny campaigners’ demands can appear naïve, out of touch, tin-eared, or indifferent to victims’ suffering; while to grant them may commit resources to punishment which could yield greater public benefit elsewhere, or upset the balance between different sentencing aims and undermine the coherence of the sentencing framework as a whole. Meanwhile, efforts to consult or solicit public opinion on sentencing more broadly may be lacking.\nThis analysis of public opinion and campaigns reveals significant tensions in how democratic legitimacy is operationalised in sentencing policy. The evidence suggests that public views on sentencing are more complex and potentially less punitive than often assumed, particularly when better informed. Yet the institutional mechanisms through which public opinion typically influences policy tend to amplify more punitive voices, creating a subtle bias toward increased severity. This raises questions about how sentencing institutions might better reflect the nuanced reality of public opinion while maintaining democratic accountability.\n\n\nPolicy implications\nThe evidence presented above about public opinion and its influence on sentencing policy suggests several key considerations for reform.\nFirst, the analysis indicates that current institutional arrangements for incorporating public views into sentencing policy may be systematically flawed. The tendency for specific campaigns to generate increased severity, combined with evidence that public opinion is actually more nuanced than often assumed, suggests that new mechanisms may be needed to capture and reflect public views more accurately.\nSecond, the evidence about how information affects public attitudes has significant implications for policy development. The finding that better-informed respondents often favour less punitive approaches suggests that any reform process should incorporate deliberative elements allowing for detailed consideration of evidence. This supports the case for mechanisms such as citizens’ assemblies, which can facilitate more informed public engagement with sentencing policy than is possible for Parliament, Government, or the Sentencing Council, each of which has a more specific (and ongoing) role.\nThird, the instability of individual punishment preferences over time raises important questions about how sentencing policy should respond to public opinion. This finding suggests that policy should not simply track apparent public preferences, but should instead seek to engage public views while maintaining consistent principles and limits, and clear frameworks for decision-making.\nThese implications point toward specific reforms in how sentencing institutions engage with public opinion:\n\nEnhanced mechanisms for informed public deliberation about sentencing policy\nBetter communication about how sentences operate in practice\nClearer frameworks for balancing public views with other considerations\nMore systematic collection of evidence about public attitudes to sentencing\n\n\n\nImplications for the review: reflecting public opinion constructively\nThe policy implications outlined above suggest that sentencing institutions can and should seek more constructive ways to engage with public opinion. The evidence indicates that public views on sentencing are more complex and potentially less punitive than often assumed, particularly when people are given detailed information about specific cases. This suggests scope for reform that better reflects the nuanced reality of public attitudes while maintaining democratic accountability.\nBuilding on these insights, Bishop James Jones’s independent commission on sentencing [2] made several detailed recommendations on how the sentencing of serious offences might be reformed, and how the ratchet referred to above might be disengaged through a process of consultation and involvement by an informed panel of public opinion. I draw the Review’s attention back to these recommendations, which I have paraphrased and summarised in the following list:\n\nA public debate on the sentencing framework for serious crimes, to be taken forward in different ways by the Law Commission, the Sentencing Council, and citizens’ assemblies;\nBetter communication with victims throughout the criminal justice process, including\nBetter communication (if the victim wants it) about how the person who victimised them is being held accountable in prison;\nBetter enforcement of existing victim entitlements;\nBetter access to restorative justice for both victims and offenders in serious cases;\nSome alterations to what the Commission called the “content” of long sentences, meaning what activities prisoners may access;\nMore scrutiny of sentence progression arrangements, to make these an explicit indicator of prison performance;\nImprovements to the parole process;\nMeasures to remedy the injustices affecting those on IPP sentences.\n\nThe Commission’s key recommendation was the first: a national debate on how the most serious cases are sentenced. Crucially, it suggested that this debate should involve not only the institutions mentioned in the Review’s call for evidence (e.g. courts, the Government, Parliament, the Sentencing Council, etc.), but also the public.\nThe mechanism which the Commission recommended for debate among the wider public was a citizens’ assembly or citizens’ jury. I remain convinced that such an arrangement would better represent public opinion than other forms of representation, including through Parliament.\nIn this section I have tried to show three things. First, that public opinion is more subtle, and may be less punitive, than is sometimes apparent to policymakers. Second, that policymakers, because they hold formal power over the sentencing process, are more likely to come under pressure to use that power to increase penalties, a position from which it is then difficult for them to reverse. And finally, that soliciting public opinion on sentencing policy via a jury-like or citizens’ assembly arrangement might represent a more constructive means than those which have channelled public opinion into sentencing policy over the last thirty or more years, and might (if this was what the public wanted) be more likely to yield a more legitimate (and perhaps less severe) sentencing framework for serious offences.\nOn this basis, I recommend that this Review should revisit the recommendations of the Commission’s report, and consider adopting them.\nThe evidence about public opinion presented above suggests scope for a more nuanced approach to sentencing serious offences than the current bifurcated framework permits.\n\n\nImplementation considerations\nThe implementation of these recommendations would require careful attention to several practical considerations:\nFirst, the design of any citizens’ assembly or similar deliberative mechanism would need careful consideration. Key questions would include:\n\nHow to ensure representative participation\nWhat information and evidence to present\nHow to structure deliberation about complex trade-offs\nHow to connect deliberative outcomes with formal policy processes\nHow to ensure that the voices of all key stakeholders were represented\n\nSecond, reforms to enhance pre-sentence assessment would require:\n\nAdditional resources for report preparation\nClear guidance on assessment frameworks\nMechanisms to link assessment outcomes with sentence planning\nTraining for staff conducting assessments\n\nThird, improved communication about sentencing would need:\n\nClear protocols for information sharing\nEnhanced capacity for victim liaison\nBetter data collection about sentence outcomes\nRegular evaluation of communication effectiveness\n\nThese implementation challenges are significant but not insurmountable. The evidence presented above suggests that addressing them would yield substantial benefits in terms of both public confidence and system effectiveness."

    "text": "Theme 5: Custodial sentences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme and question covered\n\n\n\n5: How should custodial sentences be reformed to deliver justice and improve outcomes for offenders, victims and communities?\n\n\n\nKey points and recommendations\nThis section examines how the current approach to sentencing creates particular challenges for those convicted of serious offences, who face a complex and difficult-to-navigate system of risk-based decision-making about their release. Drawing on both research evidence and direct experience of working with prisoners and being affected by serious crime, I recommend that the Review should:\n\nReform progression frameworks to better recognise evidence of personal change while maintaining appropriate public protection measures;\nCreate clearer staged incentives linked to sentence progression, particularly through earlier access to open conditions for those demonstrating meaningful engagement; and\nDevelop more sophisticated approaches to bridging prisoner and victim perspectives, including through enhanced opportunities for dialogue where appropriate.\n\nThese recommendations emerge from evidence showing systematic limitations in current approaches to risk assessment and sentence progression.\n\nEvidence: understanding risk assessment limitations\nCurrent arrangements for assessing risk in serious cases face several systematic challenges. First, violence risk assessment, like any prediction of rare events, involves significant uncertainty. Both “false positives” and “false negatives” are difficult to identify at the individual level, but the second category—those denied progression unnecessarily—is likely far larger.\nThe caution underpinning this approach is understandable given public concerns, but creates practical difficulties. It keeps many people in prison whose real risk to the public may be overstated, straining operational resources and potentially undermining sentence effectiveness. This outcome systematically affects agencies responsible for sentence administration and public protection, and creates particular challenges around access to rehabilitative interventions.\n\n\nAnalysis: bridging institutional and individual need\nDrawing on both research evidence and personal experience with serious violence, I suggest that current arrangements often create unnecessary barriers between prisoner and victim interests. My research shows that systemic frustrations—particularly regarding unclear or inconsistent progression expectations—can generate additional obstacles to meaningful engagement. When prisoners feel institutional processes have treated them unfairly, their frustration may in itself be interpreted as evidence of risk.\nIt is easy to dismiss these frustrations by saying that prisoners “did the crime” and must therefore take their punishment. However, the system should treat people fairly and victims should feel confident that it does not exacerbate the anger and alienation which may lead people to offend in the first place. Reformed progression might bridge gaps between prisoner and victim interests if they created clearer and more transparent frameworks for recognising and evidencing personal change; if they established better opportunities for victim-prisoner dialogue where appropriate; and if they ensured that progression frameworks maintained accountability while avoiding purely adversarial dynamics.\n\n\nLooking ahead\nThis analysis indicates three key areas requiring attention:\nReformed assessment frameworks for progression, which would require:\n\nDevelopment of more nuanced assessment tools\nBetter integration of evidence about personal change\nEnhanced mechanisms for challenging decisions\nRegular review of assessment outcomes\n\nChanges to progression pathways, which would involve:\n\nClear implementation guidance for staged progression\nAdditional resources for sentence planning\nEnhanced monitoring arrangements\nRegular review of effectiveness\n\nReforms to the institutional processes around progression, which would depend on:\n\nCareful change management approaches\nEnhanced staff support and development\nClear communication strategies\nRegular feedback mechanisms\n\nThese recommendations would be challenging to implement, but the challenges should be weighed against potential benefits, including more effective use of prison places, enhanced institutional legitimacy, and improved outcomes for both victims and prisoners.\n\n\n\nDetailed response: understanding risk and progression in sentencing\nThe remainder of this section examines these points in greater detail, with particular attention to how current approaches to risk assessment create systematic challenges for sentence effectiveness. This analysis begins by examining the broader context of how serious offending is dealt with in the sentencing framework.\n\nThe bifurcated approach to sentencing\nThe sentencing system is “bifurcated”, in that it “distinguishes between the treatment of”dangerous” violent and sexual offenders, and those “minor” criminals, typically found guilty of volume property offences” [10] (p. 140). As well as being subject to the ratcheting of penalties described above, it typically also subjects the first group to “an increasingly prohibitive system of discretionary decision-making, couched in the language of risk, dangerousness and public protection” [10] (p. 141). Meanwhile for the second group of more “minor” offenders, it uses non-custodial sanctions or determinate prison sentences qualifying for automatic release. The aim is to accelerate this group’s progression through the system, or to divert them from custody altogether.\n\n\nLimitations of risk-based decision making\nThough this approach to sentencing is now well entrenched, it is not without difficulties. Most fundamentally, violence risk assessment (like any activity involving the prediction of rare events) involves a high risk of error. Risk assessment involves two types of errors: releasing people who later commit serious offences (“false positives”), and keeping people in prison who would have been safe to release (“false negatives”). Because serious reoffending is rare, the system is much more likely to keep people in prison unnecessarily than to release people who go on to commit serious crimes. It is likely that far more people are held in prison when this is not necessary to protect the public, than are released when it would have been.\n\n\nPractical implications for sentence administration\nThe caution with which the Parole Board approaches its task is understandable, and is supported by what we know of public opinion on sentencing, which is more likely to support the use of prison to protect the public, than to endorse its use for any other aim. Nonetheless, given the uncertainties of risk assessment, the benefit of the doubt is systematically stacked against those “false negative” prisoners who pose no real risk to the public. The risk of procedural injustice should be named and acknowledged, even if it is considered to be an acceptable trade-off.\nMore practically, the current approach keeps many people in prison who do not in fact pose a real risk to the public. This outcome stems directly from how we treat “dangerous” offenders differently from others, while also relying on a risk assessment system which inherently tends to overestimate risk. It creates significant pressure not just on prisons, but on every agency involved in managing sentences and protecting the public. It adds to demand for accredited rehabilitative and risk-reducing interventions (since the structure of parole release sentences implies that rehabilitation must be credentialled and ‘evidence-based’), which in turn results in the rationing and demand management of these interventions. This situation has become the context for many of the difficulties with sentence progression described in the following section.\n\n\nProblems with current assumptions\nIt bears emphasis that many assumptions underpinning the bifurcated approach to more serious cases are questionable [11]. The current system expects prisoners to demonstrate they have reduced their risk before release. But this overlooks how risk often depends on changing circumstances and environments, and may be contingent on factors which do not all lie within the prisoner’s control. It also assumes that risk assessments and the prisoner classifications based on them are reliable and based on accurate, complete information. And it assumes that the thresholds between risk levels (i.e. “high”, “medium”, and “low”) are distinct and clearly identifiable, rather than arbitrary and blurred.\nThese systematic limitations of risk-based decision-making raise fundamental questions about how institutions might better balance public protection with other statutory sentencing aims. The evidence suggests that current arrangements systematically privilege certain forms of knowledge about risk over others, potentially obscuring important evidence of change and development during sentences. This approach to risk affects both how prisoners and victims experience sentences, and how we might better structure progression pathways.\n\n\nBalancing public protection with other aims\nPublic protection is, rightly, understood as an overriding aim in sentencing. However, as the report by Bishop James Jones’s sentencing commission [2] found, it can also distort the scope for the other aims of the sentence to be realised, as can the sheer length of penalty imposed in the first place. I recommend that report’s chapter on how well long sentences balance the five statutory purposes of sentencing to the Review.9\nThis section does not minimise the risks to the public associated with releasing the wrong people; it has, however, shown that the current sentencing arrangements for serious offences contain a systematic bias against the release of “false negatives”. To underline this: the current setup of risk-assessed releases means that the number of prisoners serving parole release sentences who are kept in prison unnecessarily is unquantifiable, but very likely much larger than the number who are released when they still pose a risk to the public.\nCaution with this “false negative” group is justified, but so too is an attempt to correct for the systematic bias against their progression and release. This should take the form of efforts to recognise and incentivise progression by those serving extended and indeterminate sentences who demonstrate a willingness to develop themselves. The most effective incentive, albeit one which is remote for many, is the prospect of earlier progression and release from prison. This could be achieved either by linking personal development goals to the parole eligibility date, or by permitting an increased (and earlier) use of open conditions as an incentive.\n\n\nBridging prisoner and victim perspectives: personal and institutional insights\nThe implications of reformed progression arrangements for victims require careful consideration. Drawing on both research evidence and personal experience, I want to reflect carefully on how institutions might better recognise and respond to the complex relationship between prisoner and victim perspectives.\nMy empirical research has brought me into sustained contact with people serving very long sentences, permitting close observation of how they engage, often in good faith, with institutional expectations of reform and rehabilitation. This proximity has revealed how systemic frustrations—particularly those arising from unclear or inconsistent expectations—can generate additional barriers to meaningful engagement. When prisoners feel institutional processes have treated them unfairly, the resulting frustration can itself be interpreted as evidence of risk, creating a difficult situation where legitimate grievances must often be suppressed rather than expressed.\nYet my perspective on these institutional dynamics has been profoundly shaped by personal experience of serious violence, specifically the murder of a friend. This experience might have driven me towards a more instinctively punitive standpoint. But I cannot simply discount everything I have observed about the institutional challenges faced by long-term prisoners, who often experience genuine remorse and wish to change their lives, but struggle to gain recognition and become disillusioned and alienated from the system.\nThis has led me to reflect on how sentences might better bridge the apparent gulf between prisoner and victim interests, which tends to take for granted that they are inherently opposed in a zero-sum relationship. I suggest that this gulf is not inevitable, but is often reinforced by institutions which may foster misunderstanding among victims of what a prison sentence truly demands from prisoners, while withholding recognition from those prisoners who engage with their sentences. I recommend that reformed progression arrangements could address this by:\n\nCreating clearer frameworks for recognising and evidencing personal change\nDeveloping more sophisticated approaches to risk assessment\nEstablishing better opportunities for victim-prisoner dialogue where appropriate\nEnsuring progression frameworks maintain appropriate accountability while avoiding purely adversarial dynamics\n\nThese insights align with and extend my evidence about how sentence progression might better serve both institutional and individual needs. The Independent Commission’s report on long sentences [2] (pp. 55-58) makes particularly relevant observations about institutional barriers to making amends, and about how structured opportunities for victim-prisoner dialogue might help bridge perspective gaps. These findings informed the Commission’s recommendation 5, which has direct relevance for how progression might be reformed.\n\n\nPolicy implications\nThe analysis presented above suggests several key considerations for policy reform.\nFirst, the evidence about systematic bias in risk assessment indicates a need to consider other factors than risk alone into decision-making around progression. Current arrangements appear to generate an excess of “false negatives”—prisoners denied progression despite posing manageable or minimal risks to others. There is scope for a more nuanced approach which balances public protection with recognition of personal change.\nSecond, the relationship between institutional frustration and risk assessment requires attention. When prisoners raise valid concerns about unclear progression routes or about inaccuracies in case handling, the system may interpret this as evidence of risk, making it harder for them to progress. This indicates a need for clearer frameworks for progression decision-making; mechanisms to address prisoner grievances about “blocked” progression; and more sophisticated interpretations of institutional behaviour.\nThird, the evidence about prisoner-victim perspectives suggests potential for approaches which better serve both groups’ interests, without assuming that they must be antagonistic. This might include enhanced opportunities for dialogue; better communication about progression decisions; clearer links between personal development and progression; and more sophisticated approaches to evidencing reform.\n\n\nImplementation considerations\nAddressing these considerations would require attention to several practical challenges:\nFirst, reforms to risk assessment would require:\n\nThe development of new assessment frameworks\nStaff training and development\nEnhanced quality assurance processes\nRegular evaluation of outcomes\n\nSecond, changes to progression pathways would require:\n\nClear implementation guidance\nAdditional resources for sentence planning\nEnhanced monitoring arrangements\nRegular review of effectiveness\n\nThird, institutional process reforms would need:\n\nCareful change management\nEnhanced staff support\nClear communication strategies\nRegular feedback mechanisms\n\nWhile significant, these implementation challenges should be weighed against the potential benefits:\n\nMore effective use of prison places\nEnhanced institutional legitimacy\nBetter outcomes for victims and prisoners\nImproved public protection through more accurate risk assessment\n\nSuccessful implementation would require sustained commitment but could yield substantial improvements in both system effectiveness and individual outcomes, as well as potentially reducing prison population pressures."

I also draw on focus groups carried out in my previous job, where I interviewed prisoners in three English prisons who were serving a full range of short and long sentences. During that project I also interviewed several ex-prisoners from three US states10 which use credits schemes of the kind mentioned by the Review’s call for evidence; and I learned something about how Brazilian prisons use incentives and sentence credits.\nThis section does not make substantive recommendations, but instead comments on some considerations which any reform examining the use of sentence-based incentives should consider.\n\n\nKey principles for incentivising progression\nBefore reflecting on how these examples might inform reformed UK sentence progression, it is worth underlining three general points, which are absolutely clear to me from my research and professional experience:\n\nEarlier access to open conditions, and earlier release, are by far the most appealing (and therefore effective) incentives prisons can offer;\nBetter material conditions can also be effective, but to nothing like the same extent; and\nNeither of these on its own can be assumed to reduce the risk of reoffending (although each may play its part).\n\nHowever, designing incentive schemes is a complex matter, complicated by the fact that strong incentives can generate behaviour which seeks the incentive, rather than the deeper change which the incentive aims to reward. Compliant behaviour is difficult to interpret, and strong incentives exacerbate the problem. People’s reasons for complying may vary between individuals (and within individuals over time). All of this means that incentives schemes need to be structured and designed with care, and some consideration of international examples may be useful. The Review’s call for evidence refers specifically to the use of sentence credits schemes in the United States; the following subsections examine this approach, as well as a contrasting system used in Brazil.\n\n\nInternational approaches to sentence-based progression incentives\nThe US and Brazilian systems offer contrasting approaches to incentivising progression through sentences, each highlighting different challenges and opportunities for the Review to consider.\nIn US state prisons, sentence credits schemes permit prisoners serving determinate sentences to earn remission through various activities including work, programme participation, and good behaviour. Although these schemes are governed by detailed rulebooks and policies, in practice they operate with high staff discretion. My interviews with former prisoners from Arizona, California, and Texas (which cannot be assumed to be representative) suggested that credits were often awarded, withdrawn, and reinstated arbitrarily, with limited scope for meaningful appeal. Importantly, these schemes also typically exclude prisoners serving sentences for serious violent and sexual offences. In California, for instance, life-sentenced prisoners (around one-third of the state prison population) cannot earn credits at all.\nBrazilian prisons take a markedly different approach, offering structured sentence remission which is somewhat less discretionary in nature. Every three days of work reduces the sentence by one day; similar reductions can be earned through education and other structured activities. The Lei de Execução Penal (Penal Execution Law) provides that if a prisoner is found to have committed a serious infraction (“falta grave”) in prison, then a judge may revoke up to one-third of the time already remitted.11\nSome similarities to the practices used in US states are evident here, but the differences are significant. Like in the US, Brazil can rescind some remission earned by prisoners if their disciplinary record is poor. However, unlike in the US, this is judicially overseen, not subject to staff discretion. This, and the two-thirds/one-third ratio, tend to suggest that sentence remission, once earned, “belongs” to the prisoner, and is more like a right than a privilege. Also unlike in the US, the Brazilian approach makes remission universally available in principle, without excluding some groups by offence or sentence type. In practice, though, access varies significantly, since prisons in Brazil are often severely overcrowded and work and education opportunities are often limited.12 Finally, similarly to the US, the system used in Brazil is subject to administrative challenges: recording and verifying activities is burdensome, and some states have experienced backlogs in the oversight of sentences by penal execution judges.\nThese contrasting approaches highlight some key issues for the Review’s thinking about the use of sentence-based incentives in England & Wales. The US experience suggests that unchecked staff discretion can undermine the legitimacy of incentive schemes, while the US practice of excluding serious offenders may limit the impact such incentives can make on prison populations. Brazil’s more structured approach offers clearer and more credible incentivisation in theory, and sends a strong message that compliance will be rewarded, but also indicates that operating remission schemes at scale can be administratively challenging. Both examples underline the importance of clear frameworks, consistent implementation, and adequate administrative capacity in any reform of sentence progression.\n\n\nApplying international evidence to UK reforms\nThe evidence from US and Brazilian approaches suggests several key considerations for reforming progression arrangements in England and Wales. First, any reform must carefully balance structure with discretion. The US experience shows how excessive staff discretion can undermine legitimacy and breed cynicism and disengagement among prisoners. Brazil’s more structured approach demonstrates that, in principle, clear entitlements can incentivise engagement more effectively. For the UK, this suggests a need for clear progression criteria supported by transparent decision-making processes, with some bounded discretion retained for staff but subject to effective oversight.\nSecond, the scope of eligibility requires careful consideration. The US approach of excluding serious offenders from progression incentives has contributed to growing numbers of prisoners serving very long sentences. This limits progress towards the goal of reduced prison populations, particularly in those states (like California) which have used indeterminate sentences heavily and followed a bifurcated approach (like the UK). Meanwhile, Brazil’s universal eligibility creates clearer incentives but faces practical constraints in implementation. This evidence suggests that UK reforms should aim for broad eligibility while ensuring adequate capacity to deliver progression opportunities consistently.\nThird, both international examples highlight crucial administrative challenges. Brazil’s experience shows how inadequate systems for recording and verifying activities can create serious operational problems, while the US example demonstrates how complex administrative arrangements can become divorced from their intended rehabilitative purposes. This indicates that UK reforms must be supported by robust administrative systems and adequate resources, with particular attention to record-keeping and monitoring.13\nThese insights suggest three considerations for the Review’s attention. First, progression frameworks should offer clear, staged incentives linked to rehabilitative activities, while maintaining appropriate accountability through bounded discretion and effective oversight. Second, access to progression opportunities should be as universal as possible, supported by adequate provision of work, education and other meaningful activities. Third, implementation should be underpinned by streamlined administrative systems that can reliably record and recognize prisoner development while avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nImplementation and practical considerations\nThe international evidence presented above suggests clear priorities for implementing a reformed use of sentence-based incentives, as part of improved sentence progression arrangements in England and Wales.\nThe first requirement is a careful design of incentive frameworks, to balance progression opportunities with accountability. This means developing clear criteria for earning progression, with transparent decision-making processes and effective oversight mechanisms. The criteria should reward meaningful engagement with rehabilitative activities while maintaining appropriate accountability for serious offending.\nThe second priority is establishing robust administrative systems. These must be capable of recording and verifying prisoner activities consistently, while avoiding the bureaucratic complexity that has undermined similar schemes elsewhere. Experience from both the US and Brazil indicates that successful implementation rests heavily on efficient administration, and that a failure to ensure this can undermine the effectiveness of the schemes. Adequate staffing, clear record-keeping protocols, and regular monitoring are all essential if the challenges of implementation are to be addressed.\nThe third requirement is maintaining consistent implementation across the prison estate. This means ensuring adequate provision of work, education and other activities through which progression can be earned. It also requires clear communication about progression opportunities and regular staff training. Without consistent implementation, any progression framework risks losing legitimacy and effectiveness.\nRegular evaluation is the fourth and final essential element. This should examine both implementation quality and outcomes, with particular attention to whether progression opportunities are being offered equitably, how progression decisions are being made in practice, what impact reformed arrangements have on prisoner engagement, and (in the longer term) whether the changes are supporting reduced reoffending."

    "text": "Yesterday I gave a talk as part of the University of Southampton’s Love Data Week 2025, exploring how qualitative researchers might engage constructively with calls to share their data openly. Drawing on the particular example of prison research (which exemplifies and sharpens many of the ethical tensions in qualitative research more generally), the talk examined particular challenges around confidentiality, consent, and institutional power.\nIt also referred to my recent work with an interdisciplinary working group in Cambridge. We tried to develop a way of talking and thinking about ‘openness’ and qualitative methods, but without using terms derived from quantitative social sciences and the STEMM disciplines.1 This was because we thought those frameworks often misdescribe qualitative data, obscuring both the arguments in favour of making qualitative research more open, and the difficulties involved.\n1 For example, those posited by the FAIR framework on data curation.The talk, as well as revisiting that working group’s report, explored how there might be productive ways for qualitative researchers to engage with calls for transparency while still honouring their methodological and ethical commitments. The presentation also engaged with recent developments in the field, particularly an ongoing debate in US criminology about qualitative data sharing policies, which has branched out into a wider discussion of transparency and quality standards.\nMy argument in the paper was that these issues—transparency and quality—appear to be more fundamental than the question of whether open data publication per se should become the norm for qualitative researchers. There are ways that qualitative researchers could make it easier for others to evaluate their knowledge claims, not all of which necessarily require the publication of sensitive datasets. I may try to develop these ideas further with some colleagues, so I’d welcome feedback on this working paper.\nSlides and full text are available on this site:\n\nPaper text\nSlides\n\nFor my earlier work on this topic, see:\n\n“Can confidential research be reproducible?” (2021)\n“Open Data and sensitive interviews” (2020)\n“Voice, representation, relationships: report of the Open Qualitative Working Group” (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPhoto by Viktor Forgacs on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0"

    "text": "Why life imprisonment?\nOverall, the research focuses on life imprisonment, and specifically people serving mandatory life sentences for murder. Life sentences have been increasing, both in number and in length. There are now thousands of people serving life sentences who will be imprisoned for decades to come. This alone is a reason to think carefully about how such a heavy sanction is used against them, whether it is effective, justified, what kinds of challenges it poses, and so on.\nBut what the research is mostly interested in is how people’s self-image — who they think they are and who they want to become — changes while they are serving very long prison sentences. This isn’t currently very well understood: previous studies of long-term imprisonment shed some light on the issue, but because life sentences were shorter and prison conditions were very different when they were carried out, they are not always relevant to today’s situation."

    "text": "What I’m trying to research\nThe title of the blog highlights the idea that people change while they are imprisoned, but also signals that my main interest is in how people’s self-image change, and also whether and how this gets recognised by others. The research I am carrying out aims to fill some of the gaps I’ve just described. Among other things, it is interested in:\n\nhow prisoners experience their very long sentences\nwhether they perceive themselves to be morally stigmatised by their offending, and whether this feels permanent\nwhether they are interested in trying to become ‘better’ people (as opposed to, say, ‘fighting the system’) and what this means to them\nwhether the stage they are at in their sentence makes a difference\nwhether some murders are harder to ‘move on’ from than others\nwhat this might mean for how long-term imprisonment should be thought about (and organised)\n\nThere are resources available to help with the task. Particularly, a rich body of recent criminological research into ‘desistance’ — that is, how people change and ‘desist from’ (or move away) from criminality — contains relevant theories and ideas. This research has not been applied much to the most serious offences, or to long-term imprisonment, but this project seeks to fill that gap. Since around the turn of the millennium, there has also been a great deal of anthropological research on ‘ethical development’, meaning ‘how people (including those in very difficult circumstances) think about what a good life might be, and what they do as a result’. This second body of work is interesting because it helps to think about what it might mean to be a ‘good’ person when you’re serving a long sentence in an institution created to hold ‘bad’ people. How do people hold those opposites in tension?"

    "text": "In setting up this project, and obtaining permission to carry out the research, one thing that took some time to get right was the Participant Information Sheets (PIS). These contain information about the project and what it’s doing, and set out certain information relevant to the interviewee’s informed consent, such as: steps taken to protect their identity and their data; how they can withdraw themselves from the study if they change their minds; how they can complain about me if they wish to; and what the legal rules governing their personal data are. I had to send drafts to HM Prison and Probation Service’s National Research Committee, to my department’s Ethics Committee, and I also got some specific advice from my university about GDPR requirements.\nDespite reservations from some of those sources about the readability and length, the original draft as amended by them ended up at seven A4 pages long, including GDPR compliance text and the reply slip. The mere existence of the PIS sets in motion an assumed research choreography, with steps 1 to 5 determind in advance, and steps 6 and 7 added by the prison where I am doing fieldwork at present. Here’s how that choreography goes:\n\nI identify a sample randomly from a list;\nI send the people in it an information sheet;\nThey read and consider the contents;\nThey send back the response slip, saying ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘can I ask you some questions before I decide?’;\nAs appropriate, I set up interviews, have further conversations, or replace those who decline;\nI run the names of randomly-selected participants past particular prison staff, who veto interviews if they see the person concerned as particularly vulnerable, and\nAfter an interview, I write some notes to be entered on the prison database, describing the interviewee’s emotional state during the interview and notifying prison staff if I thought they might require support.\n\nThis choreography presupposes a number of things about the normal nature of the research relationship:\n\nthat it is the researcher and the prison, not the participants, who hold power;\nthat it is the researcher who initiates contact;\nthat participants are vulnerable, or (by default) at risk of being harmed by their participation;\nthat it is for the researcher and the authorities to act to protect them from harm, and\nthat interviews will usually take place and be arranged by working sequentially through these steps.\n\nIn prisons research, where access can be tricky (and conditional), these are effectively the ‘rules of the game’, negotiated in advance with the authorities, to which you’re accountable.\nWhile there are very good reasons for having these default assumptions, in practice the task of actually getting the research done can call some of these rules—and particularly some of what they take for granted—into question.\nSince I’ve been conducting my fieldwork for a couple of months now, and have been finding it quite difficult to write coherently about what I am seeing, hearing and finding in the prison, the next few posts on this blog will concentrate on some dilemmas and strange situations that have come up in the research, which I have found interesting because they have provoked reflection on some of the ‘rules of the game’, the situations in which they do and don’t apply, and the questions, dilemmas and difficulties they create.\nSo this is the first of what I hope will become a series of posts reflecting on these methodological and ethical issues in the research process. The next two will reflect on one interview in particular, with a man seen by the prison as ‘a powerful prisoner’, who wasn’t particularly willing to play the game exactly as these rules suggested he should.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

    "text": "Arguing for an end to rehabilitation\nAs a consequence of the arguments I summarised in the first post in this series, the AFSC report’s authors argued for a range of reforms which deliberately excluded rehabilitation as an aim of punishment. One example that they demanded was an end to indeterminate sentences. Although today (in England and Wales, at least, and with the significant exception of the much-criticised IPP sentence) these are used only for more serious offences. However, they were relatively common in post-war America. Rather than being imprisoned for set period of time, many prisoners were detained at the discretion of prison officials, who possessed the power to judge whether they were ‘reformed’ (and therefore eligible for parole) or not.\nThe kinds of experience this provoked can be seen in a famous scene from the film The Shawshank Redemption.\nI like how this clip captures the powerlessness and disillusionment felt by prisoners who could come before parole boards again and again without knowing the standards by which they were being judged."

They therefore served the interests of prison staff, not of prisoners who they were intended to benefit. Moreover, the report argued, this was done in a discriminatory way: it systematically disadvantaged prisoners (often non-white, uneducated and poor) who prison officials (often white, educated and middle-class) were more likely to regard as ‘dangerous’.\nThis was done in a way which systematically disadvantaged prisoners (often non-white, uneducated and poor) who prison officials (often white, educated and middle-class) were more likely to regard as ‘dangerous’."

    "text": "Limits to rehabilitative knowledge\nRehabilitative punishment has a contradiction at its heart: it’s extremely difficult to predict with perfect certainty how another human being will act, whether they have ‘changed’, or whether they are ‘dangerous’. People are different in different contexts, and might respond in different ways if presented with different sets of provocations; to some degree, practices like parole and ‘furloughs’ (temporary releases) were originally intended to permit such changes of circumstance to be monitored and managed in controlled conditions.\nEven so, the kind of knowledge and reciprocal trust which might give us reasonable confidence in some people some of the time, cannot easily be obtained through surveillance and coercion. For authors of Struggle for Justice, they were so difficult to achieve, and so vulnerable to corruption under the imbalances of power present in prisons, that they tended to come down not to fine, contextual judgment and ‘deep knowledge’ of prisoners by staff; but instead were over-reliant on crude and imperfect (but observable) indicators of change, such as reconviction rates. These, however, were highly problematic means of approaching the question of whether to trust someone enough to release them:\nWe have no way of determining the real rate of recidivism because most criminals are undetected and most suspected criminals do not end up being convicted. Recidivism rates are also subject to […] unconscious bias […] introduced by the tendency of predictive and diagnostic judgments to become self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, those release on parole from a treatment program are likely to be formally or informally classified for the purpose of parole supervision into good risks (responded favorably to treatment) and poor risks (resisted treatment). The [latter] are likely to be subjected to tighter surveillance; their violations are therefore much more likely to be detected; their parole is more likely to be revoked; and the resulting differences in recidivism rates emerge as a “research finding” validating the efficacy of the particular treatment program. Struggle for Justice, pp.42-3\nIn the face of such difficulties, it appeared to the authors of Struggle for Justice that punishment should be very strictly limited in scope and in ambition, giving up its claim over the prisoner’s subjectivity, and instead opting for a more limited (but controllable) conception of the aims of punishment:\n\n[T]he whole person is not the concern of the law. Whenever the law considers the whole person it is more likely that it considers [irrelevant] factors [which relate instead to] influence, power, wealth and class [and not] the needs […] of the defendant […] Focusing on the criminal rather than the crime tends to [neglect] the more tenable view that criminal acts are committed by a very large number of persons […] spread throughout all sectors of society. &gt;\nStruggle for Justice, pp.147-8"

While convinced that it would be better to ‘tear down’ all jails than to ‘perpetuate the inhumanity and horror being carried on in society’s name behind prison walls’ (p.23), the authors were not convinced by the argument for prison abolition, a scepticism which may have followed from their belief that rehabilitative aims had only served to disguise the true nature of punishment. Prison abolition, they said, would simply result in the need to replace prisons with some other form of coercive institution, and thus constitute ‘label switching’:\n\n[C]all them “community treatment centers” or what you will, if human beings are involuntarily confined in them they are prisons.\nStruggle for Justice (p.23)\n\nTheir answer was to limit the aims and scope of punishment.

Here the report’s authors were espousing what became known as ‘truth in sentencing’.\nThe law should specify a set of clearly-stated punishments, specified for all crimes. Where a crime was serious enough to mean imprisonment, sentences were to be determinate (i.e. of a fixed length). Penalties should be backwards not forwards-looking, in other words. They should apply identically to all people convicted of a given crime, and should be used only when all of the following conditions apply (pp. 149-153):\n\nthere is a ‘compelling social need to compel compliance’ (i.e. others’ rights or safety are threatened by a given person’s conduct, rather than their moral views offended by it);\nthere is no feasible but less costly way to obtain compliance;\npunishment is expected to produce a greater benefit for society than simply doing nothing;\nother courses of action have been exhausted;\npunishment is no more severe than necessary;\npunishment must fit the crime (rather than having ambitions to ‘treat’ the person).\n\nMeanwhile, the aim of making people ‘better’ should be organised on different lines, and freed of coercion:\n\nWe recommend that a full range of therapy, counseling, and psychiatric and educational services be made avaialable, free, on a voluntary basis, to the entire population, inside prisons and on the street.\nStruggle for Justice, p.171\n\nThe AFSC’s was not the only call for the reform of rehabilitative punishment in the 1970s. Like many reforms, these calls melded with other agendas, combining with unforeseen consequences which reformers would not have wished for. This is a fascinating and tragic cautionary tale, but it has been well told elsewhere.\nIn a final post in this series, I will think about how relevant the findings of Struggle for Justice are in the UK today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImage in the public domain, via Wikimedia Commons."

It’s based on historical research I carried out last year, before starting the PhD, with Caroline and other colleagues from Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh. We investigated what safeguards existed to try and prevent child abuse in youth prisons between 1960 and the present day, and how they changed. It’s a grim topic, so I can’t say that I’m delighted about publishing it. But I am proud of the work.\nYouth custody in the past was often marked by extensive staff and inmate violence, and sometimes by sexual abuse. The issue became topical again while the article was being peer-reviewed: officers who worked there in the 1970s and 1980s were themselves imprisoned for historic abuse.\nOur report to the Prison Service (which commissioned the research) was published last year. This newer journal article covers only the earlier period, and asks why the safeguards which were in place from 1960 to 1990 so comprehensively failed to prevent abuse.\nThe recent convictions, coming at a time where violence in youth prisons is in the headlines, and inspectorates and others are expressing serious concerns about their safety, have reinforced contemporary calls for an end to child imprisonment. We argue in the article that while the failures of the past (like those of today) have complex causes, now is a good time to be reflecting on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPhoto by Maria Sol Ponce on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{jarman2019,\n  author = {{Ben Jarman} and Jarman, Ben},\n  title = {New Publication: “{A} Poor Prospect Indeed”},\n  date = {2019-04-18},\n  url = {https://benjarman.uk/changing-inside/poor-prospect-indeed.html},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBen Jarman, & Jarman, B.

Broadly, this is that recent research into long-term imprisonment may have oversimplified the process of ‘adaptation’: how people adjust to the shock and dislocation of a very long prison sentence.\nPast research has tended to find that most long-term prisoners find ways of coping with the sentence, albeit that it is often painful and difficult. Despite struggling to begin with, they find ways to move forwards, often coming to re-evaluate the lives they were leading before their conviction. By the later stages of the sentence, most become self-controlled, strategic, and reflective, and many embrace very different aims for the future after prison (though they still face formidable barriers after release). This is a clear finding, especially associated with those serving indeterminate sentences, for whom the choice is stark: comply with the expectation to demonstrate change, or face the probability of growing old and dying in prison.\nHowever, the article argues that recent studies of life and long-term imprisonment have tended to miss some factors which might complicate the picture."

    "text": "The effects of age and the life course\nRecent studies have either i) sampled people who were convicted young; or ii) not compared people who were convicted at different ages.\nThis matters if we’re thinking about how people adapt. Not all lifers were young when given their sentences: in fact, in all my research, the average age at conviction of the men I’ve interviewed was just under 32, with the youngest still a child at the time of his offence and the eldest in his mid-seventies. A long prison sentence will look substantially different if you think you might be released in your forties, compared to your eighties (or older); in one case it’s possible to foresee a life afterwards, while in the other the sentence might literally feel like the end of your life.\nThe result is that we have a picture of adaptation that’s not as nuanced as it could be. It’s hard to see how people starting out from different places in life think differently about their situation. What kinds of future do they foresee after prison? Do they prepare for these, and how? Are the issues they face after release the same in all cases? How do the answers to all these questions vary for those convicted at different ages, or coming from different socio-economic backgrounds?"

But there’s no reason to assume that everyone serving a long sentence for a serious offence — murder, say — is similar. In fact, they are a diverse group; and different crimes committed in different kinds of circumstances are seen by the law (and often by wider society) as embodying different kinds of risk and culpability. All murders lead to a life sentence; but because English law defines ‘murder’ broadly, anything from so-called ‘one punch’ or ‘mercy’ killings to sadistic serial killings count as the same crime.\nHere, again, I think we need to ask how this affects the way people see their sentences. Do some people think what they did was (relatively) more or less serious? How far do they feel guilt and shame? Do some feel their sentences, and their punishment, to be deserved and if so, does this affect the way they engage with the prison’s attempts to ‘rehabilitate’ them and induce them to ‘change’? Are some people more likely to see a ‘way back’ after punishment? And if they can’t, what does this mean how they prepare for their future lives?"

This leaves us with quite an untextured view.\nSuch an untextured view can also be conflated with another fact that’s very clear in the aggregate: reconviction rates among long-sentenced prisoners are very low. A clear adaptation process, and low reconviction rates, both taken together as aggregate phenomena, can be conflated to give the impression that long sentences somehow ‘succeed’ or ‘work’. The current government appears to have done precisely this, misunderstanding or misrepresenting the findings of one study to suggest that longer sentences actually benefit prisoners. The Prison Reform Trust recently described this move as ‘disingenuous at best’ (PRT 2020: 5)."

Here, the aim is retribution, achieved by setting a minimum length of time in prison for someone given a life sentence. These ‘tariffs’ are now as long as they have ever been, but there is no obvious way to set an upper limit: how many years in prison is enough, when a life has been taken? Unless life imprisonment is to mean life in all cases (and I’d suggest that it’s a serious wrong to punish a mercy killing and a multiple murder the same), then it’s probable that we will continue to impose minimum terms of some kind, after which release can be considered based on risk.\nThis is why sentences also aim at public protection. One way they try to achieve this is by attempting to rehabilitate people, so that they can ‘reduce risk’. But risk does not start the same, or change in the same ways, in all cases. Risk assessment is also, at least to some degree, a question of subjective interpretation, meaning that people serving life sentences sometimes disagree with (or don’t understand) official judgements about the ways in which they are ‘risky’. This has the potential to lead to people who pose a genuine risk of harm being released having successfully put on a performance for risk assessors; it also has the potential to cause some people who pose no real risk of harm to become ‘lost’ in the system, stuck in prison long after the point where anyone is benefiting by their continued imprisonment."

I attended the meeting, and though it’s too early to give details about the positions they will be taking up, it’s safe to say efforts will be directed towards regional and global institutions which set guidance and standards for criminal justice in their member states, such as the UN Office for Drugs and Crime. The idea of a ‘right to hope’ was selected as a slogan for the campaign, influencing my choice of image for this post.\nThe scale and long-term nature of the campaign, means my small-scale PhD research won’t have much direct influence, because it focuses on how prisons manage life-sentenced prisoners, and not on sentencing law in itself. But it is something that readers might want to follow. If you have a connection with campaigning organisations which take an international perspective, then you could consider asking them whether they might want to get involved with the coalition, once it is under way."

    "text": "A global perspective\nThe rest of this post discusses some issues arising from the presentations I heard and the discussions I had at the meeting. My last post linked to the PRT’s most recent Bromley Briefing, the latest instalment of their indispensable guide to the facts and figures relating to imprisonment in this country. One key focus in it was a section on life sentences, marking the publication next month of a major study by Dirk van Zyl Smit and Catherine Appleton of the University of Nottingham, analysing the use of such sentences worldwide. Their book has prompted the PRI work, and a summary of the main findings can be found here.\nLast week I highlighted one striking finding from that book, namely that the UK has the largest number of life-sentenced prisoners in Europe, making up up a higher proportion of the prison population in 2014 (10.5%) than in the United States (9.5%). Most concerningly, from a global perspective, is the growth in lifer numbers worldwide. The best available estimates suggest that while there were 261,000 lifers worldwide in 2000, there were 479,000 in 2014, getting on for a doubling within a 15-year period."

    "section": "Drivers of growth",
    "text": "Drivers of growth\nOne driver of growth appears to be the gradual abolition of the death penalty, something that has been subject to widespread campaigning. Life imprisonment has often been adopted by different countries as the default alternative to capital punishment, meaning that in some sense the growth in lifer numbers has been an unintended consequence of reform efforts elsewhere.\nAnother driver of growth in lifer numbers has been the tendency of states to adopt mandatory life sentencing for a wide range of offences, not always the most serious. A particular factor here is the use of life sentences for people convicted of repeat offences. The ‘three-strikes’ laws passed by many US states are one widely-criticised example, and in some cases have led to life sentences for people convicted of comparatively trivial crimes.\nAnother relevant factor, in countries where life sentences feature some possibility of release, is the increasing length of the minimum terms which lifers must serve before there is any possibility of release. These do not apply everywhere, however: in some countries, life imprisonment only exists in law as a sentence without any possibility of parole, meaning that people sentenced to it will die in prison.\nFinally, because the number of lifers in prison is affected not only by the number of new sentences but also by the rate at which they are released into the community, and whether they are recalled to prison, lifer numbers overall are also affected by official thinking about whether and how lifers become ‘rehabilitated’.\nWhy should anyone care about this? There are a number of reasons for concern, among them the cost of imprisoning people past the end of their minimum terms if they are not genuinely dangerous. Comparing the UK’s heavy use of indeterminate imprisonment with that in other countries is an interesting way to think about this. One interpretation could be that a larger proportion of UK prisoners are extremely dangerous people. Another could be that there is something unusually punitive about UK sentencing, or unusually restrictive in our official thinking about how and when lifers can safely be released."

    "text": "A right to hope?\nQuite apart from considerations of cost are more fundamental questions about whether life sentences are consistent with human rights, most particularly when they are imposed without any possibility of parole (known in England and Wales as a ‘whole life tariff’ or in the US as Life Without Parole or LWOP). Some see this denial of any right to hope as cruel and excessive, and from a practical point of view it also means that prisons have to cope with prisoners who have little reason to comply, both factors which featured in a 2013 European Court of Human Rights judgment on a case brought by three whole-lifers in England and Wales.\nSince, globally speaking, not all prisoners in this position have committed serious or even violent offences, it is legitimate to ask whether such penalties are merited, and where the line ought to lie. Some questions that this all left me with were as follows (and I’d welcome your thoughts):\n\nWhat’s the right thing to do with someone who committed terrible offences many years ago?\nAre there ever good reasons for keeping people imprisoned for ever?\nIs there a right to hope?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImage credit: Greg Rosenke, via Unsplash."

I could tell on the first conversation that the person was interested in doing it, but also that he had had multiple worries about interview topics, the possibility that the interview might be recorded, and so on. One of his questions was whether the interview resulted in entries on his prison file. I told him that I had to write down something about the interview (‘rule of the game’ no. 7) but also that I would keep my comments to a minimum. Here I was conscious of what others have said about the ‘power of the pen’ and the potential for ambiguously-recorded information in prison files to come back and haunt the subject of those comments years later. I could tell immediately that my answer disappointed (or possibly annoyed) him.\nHe said that he was only interested in participating if the interview would result in a positive entry. He had a parole hearing coming up, and wanted positive comments on his record. I said I saw no harm in writing a slightly fuller note than usual, and making sure that it recorded his participation had been voluntary and positive. Immediately this felt something of a departure from the ‘rules of the game’.\nHe also wanted to pre-vet the questions. I wasn’t willing to agree to this, but reiterated one of the more minor ‘rules of the game’, spelled out in the participant information sheet: that he would be able to decline to answer any of my questions without giving a reason."

I do two interviews with each person: a relatively unstructured narrative interview about life before prison where I set the general direction but participants are largely in control of what they say. In this first interview, I limit myself to clarifying or probing things that they have said, but I never challenge or imply disbelief. The second interview is a more structured, more thematic one, beginning with a briefer narrative, but then diving into some more abstract topics drawing from the material in the first interview and experiences in prison.\nThe man I’ve described here spent much of the first interview describing his frustration at how difficult it had been for him to get downgraded to his current security category. He expressed this complaint using a common metaphor: that in the ‘fishbowl’ of prison, you are swimming around in a restricted space, unsure who is observing you, what they will see, how they will understand it, and what they will record about it. This metaphor is spot-on, and affects researchers too: I have a half-written blog post in the pipeline about how this same feeling of being under scrutiny affects the choices I make in fieldwork."

He related how chance comments, days when he was tired or in a bad mood, horseplay with friends, anything really, could be recorded in a file and then brought up again later. Such details, he said, would sometimes be invoked at meetings concerning his progression. “You say that you have become calmer since your last review, Mr X; but on the 14th of May Officer So-and-So wrote that you became angry in a conversation about an application you put in”. He said that information like this would be ‘twisted’ into evidence that he was still the risky person he once was, that he must still ‘jump through some more hoops’ before he was ‘ready’ to move on: do another course, spend another year under observation, keep a clean nose for a bit longer.\nHe was particularly frustrated by the relationship between the objectives and targets that he had been set in sentence plans and the like, which were clear and above board, and the feeling that these kinds of factoids in files were mobilised ‘against the rules’ implied by these objectives, and used to label him as ‘manipulative’, ‘powerful’, a ‘gangster’ and so on. He spent some time describing how that he had completed all the courses that were required of him and had had a clean prison disciplinary record for many years.\nI haven’t yet seen his file, and so I can’t yet verify what he told me against other records; but he has given permission for me to read it, so it would feel surprising if he was completely misleading me, since he knows that I will check it eventually. But whatever I find there, the sentiments in his description of this situation were strong ones, and the figures of speech he used to describe it were telling: ‘catch-22’; ‘moving the goalposts’; ‘guinea pigs’; ‘lab rats’; the ‘hamster wheel’."

    "section": "Questions raised by this research",
    "text": "Questions raised by this research\n\nInstitutionalisation?\nIn my experience, one of the common-sense ideas people refer to when talking about imprisonment is that prisoners come out ‘institutionalised’. The term goes back to a classic 1940 text by Donald Clemmer, who coined the term ‘prisonization’ to describe ‘the taking on, in greater or lesser degree, of the folkways, mores, customs, and general culture of the penitentiary’ (1940: 299). The implication is that prisoners come out of prison worse off than at the start.\nWhen I say that the idea is ‘common-sense’, I mean that it’s used as though its implications are obvious, but like many common-sense ideas, I think it’s also worth examining whether it’s the case or not. It’s clear from this study that being imprisoned for a long time shapes your subjectivity. This makes intuitive sense in the terms of life outside: going to a certain university or working in a certain company will present you with a set of cultural norms, which will shape your cultural mindset. You can react in different ways: by adapting; or seeking alliances and struggling to change the institution; or leaving to find a more amenable environment.\nIn prisons, however, these options are fewer. Lifers cannot easily leave for pastures new. They have very limited control over the prison regime, the way in which they can spend their time, and so on. So if they wish to be released at the end of the tariff, only the first of these three options – adaptation – appears a safe and productive choice, and that in turn requires a turn inwards and a focus on the self. Therefore the adaptive pressures for long-term prisoners are particularly intense, to the extent that they seem eventually to ‘flatten’ (Crewe et al. 2017: 538) all imported distinctions among lifers, who as a result are shaped into a particular kind of person: inward-looking, reserved, self-controlled.\nWe can see this as a form of ‘institutionalisation’, but I don’t think it automatically follows that this is a change for the worst. It’s not clear how well these adaptations serve lifers after their release from prison, nor whether other factors affect their ability to make something positive of their time outside prison. It also appears that many of those who were interviewed in the study see these adaptations as (at worst) a mixed blessing and (at best) a necessary evil.\n\n\nAdaptation… to what?\nIt is also clear from the study that the forms taken by such introspection and reflectiveness are influenced by the cultural materials on hand in the prison. Faith-related activities are mentioned in the article, and are relatively easy to access in prison (compared with education, for example). They appear to be influential for those who participate in them partly because they offer access to techniques of self-management such as meditation and prayer; and partly because they offer terms in which to reimagine and reinterpret one’s history, and seek to resolve the problem of self-forgiveness. Similarly, physical self-cultivation (through sport and prison gyms) was mentioned by many participants as an important practice, adding rhythm to the monotony of prison life and a set of yardsticks by which to measure the self:\n\nGymnasium has been the most constructive thing for me because I started to train seasonally, so in winter I would bulk up, in summer I would cut up. And I started to think in seasons and just throw everything into gym, so I’d surround meself with guys that go to the gym. We’d converse. We’d cook high-protein meals, we’d go to the gym together. […] So you become very focused on a period of time, and everything around your prison sentence is all shaped around that […] and it’s surprising just how one day merges into the next.\n‘Bernard’ (not his real name)\n\nThe study suggests that creating a ‘better self’ for the future is something that people serving life sentences for murder come to see as a kind of personal project or ‘ultimate concern’. It represents the best means of making meaning and purpose from the sentence when the original harm of the offence can’t be put right. But it also suggests that how they do this is strongly influenced by what’s on offer. For example, higher education is difficult to access, and seems to play a smaller role than the gym or faith activities. We might ask, therefore: what cultural and social resources are on offer in the prison, and how do these affect the kinds of people that life imprisonment produces?\n\n\nAdaptation… from what?\nIf (at least for people convicted of murder) the offence itself is a significant factor in how they adapt, then this raises many further questions. The definition of murder in English law is particularly broad, and the same conviction can encompass a variety of very different acts, which can reasonably be supposed to have different moral implications and to generate differing degrees of stigma. The authors note that prisoners with Joint Enterprise convictions had particular difficulty adapting to imprisonment, because they harboured lingering doubts about the legitimacy of their sentences. I wonder whether it might also be more difficult for people who have committed particularly stigmatised or notorious offences to ‘accept responsibility’; whether, in short, some things appear to be more forgivable than others? The intuitive answer is ‘yes’, but I’m not sure that is a very good basis on which\nTherefore I think these papers also generate a number of questions which need further thought, but can’t easily be answered using the data from this study. For example:\n\nEveryone in this study was aged under 25 when they received their life sentence. Do these findings apply equally to people who were older when they were sentenced, or are their views of the past, present and future somewhat different?\nIs the reflective process of coming to terms with the sentence and the offence equally easy for all lifers? Are some offences perceived to be more shameful than others, and is it harder to accept responsibility in these cases?\nWhat part is played by rehabilitative interventions? Do lifers feel they help or hinder the process of coming to terms with the offence, or are they irrelevant to it? What does this mean for sentence planning and prison management?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

    "text": "Another reflection based on interview coding. This time it’s someone I’ll call P. He’d been in prison since I was at primary school (I’m pushing 40 now), and was serving a sentence for a very highly stigmatised offence.\n\nLiving with labels\nP spoke at length about labels deriving from his offence, and their consequences. I asked whether it had been possible during his sentence for him to have honest conversations with others about such matters. Usually, the answer to this question from participants was ‘no’, or sometimes a very qualified ‘yes’.\nP said:\n\nP: Those are the only people that I want around me.\nBJ: Do you mean you deliberately spend your time with people with whom you can have [those kinds of] conversations?\nP: Who are open and honest and hide nothing and have no agenda, yes.\nBJ: Right.\nP: Yes.\nBJ: Yes. Are you open with people you associate with about what you’re in for?\nP: Yes. A lot of people don’t like that, either.\nBJ: Don’t like it?\nP: Yes. They resent your inner strength, for some reason.\n\nHe went on to describe how his efforts to care for a seriously ill friend had been misinterpreted by his peers:\n\nP: I was cleaning his pad out because he was a mate from way back [in HMP X]. A lifer. […] He was bedridden. I got him back on his feet, I got him eating properly, sorting out his meals for him, disinfecting everything, changing his food bag, changing his shit bag, collecting his canteen. Then [when he was better], getting him on his feet, into the ambulance to [hospital] where they were helping him [with his recovery], until he was up and about. When I [began], he was a fucking skeleton in bed waiting to die. Got accused of taxing his canteen when I had to go and collect his… [pause] So, I’d fill his thing in for him. “Yes, what do you want?” Because he was a smoker. “Yes, yes, yes, da-da-da.” So, I’d go and collect his canteen because he couldn’t get it, couldn’t do anything strenuous. I’d collect his meals, take his washing. Because he was a mate. Eventually, they moved me into his pad […] [He] loved it. He had something to fight for, someone that believed in him, and it got him back on his feet. He said, “I’m never going to forget you,” he said, “because I was ready for the off.” Then when I got shipped out, it all came to light that people had been putting notes in the box that I was bullying him and taking his canteen off him and taking his food off him. […]\nBJ: Forgive me if I’ve misunderstood you, but do you mean that people were [putting those notes in] because they don’t like your offence? Or was there something else going on?\nP: I don’t know what their agenda is.\n\nThis story was his answer to my question about whether others expressed moral judgements about him. Though he didn’t know their agenda, it was clear to me P thought these allegations followed from suspicion and labels based on his offence. (He didn’t say if the prison had acted on or upheld these accusations. I didn’t ask, but I saw nothing in his files about them.)\n\n\nMaking sense of labels\nI want to be clear: P wasn’t exactly saying it was unfair to be labelled. He didn’t imply he wasn’t to blame for the offence, and in describing it he didn’t sugarcoat or hide the details. What he said and what his files said about his offence was consistent. It was difficult to hear, and is upsetting to think about.\nRather, I think his account draws attention to how, in encouraging people to address their offending behaviour, prisons push a strong (and justifiable) moral message, relating to openness, honesty and self-disclosure. Not everyone I interviewed had internalised this to the same degree as P, and many others were much more guarded. But in his case, P’s openness clashed with the moral norms of the world around him. His determination to follow this moral code as far as he did had had consequences.\nHis account suggests a few things:\n\nthat it’s not normal or pleasant to hear about such things; on some level, other people just don’t want to know;\nthat once someone consents to be labelled based on actions they take responsibility for, but can’t take back, everything else they ever do may be seen through this lens;\nthat the risk of that happening increases the more shocking, unaccountable or stigmatising the offence might be;\nthat this creates all kinds of risks for the person carrying these labels, including that their efforts to do or be good will be viewed with suspicion.\n\n\n\nLabels and punishment\nNot all lifers consent to being labelled in this way, and not all are under equal pressure to do so. Those who do practise openness and honesty expose themselves to what those practices can provoke, including powerful moral sentiments such as outrage, indignation and disgust. P’s anecdote suggests this may have caused other prisoners to label him. If complaints about bullying and exploitation by P had been upheld by the prison, they could have had consequences for him. He also said, elsewhere in the interview, that he felt his honesty with prison staff had caused risk factors to be added to his formulation, resulting in new sentence plan requirements, greater scope for non-compliance with expanded and more complex requirements, and (potentially) more time in prison.\nOne way to understand this is as risk assessment and management, working exactly as they should. Another way to understand it, especially if it’s happening after the tariff date when the ‘penalty phase’ of the life sentence is complete, is as the penalisation of honesty. The more so if powerful emotions like disgust are involved. (Incidentally, here I want to acknowledge unrelated comments by Rob Canton and Fergus McNeill in two webinars on parole earlier this week; they helped clarify the points in this paragraph, which I’ve been thinking about for a while).\nThis isn’t easy territory. I don’t think (and P certainly didn’t think) that P didn’t deserve punishment for the crime he was in prison for. Nevertheless, what people’s past actions deserve and what they might do in the future are different questions. Related, but not identical. There’s a risk that for those working towards something better, experiences of labelling and distrust simply make the effort feel hopeless. Why bother?\n\n\nBeing ‘good’\nP’s response to this problem was to maintain a strong sense of himself as a good person (in criminological jargon, a desistance narrative), and to associate with those he thought would help him uphold it, in spite of everything.\nBut having spent most of my lifetime in prison, it was clear that he had had enough and was eager to move on. He summed this up nicely, so I’ll give him the last word:\n\nP: People say, “Oh, do you regret what you did?” And you’re always going to regret what you did, but you can’t undo it. You have to live with it and learn from it and move on.\nBJ: Is there a difference between regret and remorse for you?\nP: No. It’s all regrettable and it’s all remorseful. Without it, who would I be? Where would I be? Would I have ever had a wake-up call? Would I have experienced the things I’ve experienced? It’s a hard one, that one. I know it’s heinous, horrendous, horrible, all the fucking expletives you want to throw at it. All the nasty, horrible… But even roses grow out of shit, don’t they? And that’s, you know, prison. Prison has had its uses [for me]. But I don’t want to be a caretaker for every fucker else. I need to move on and take care of myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPhoto by John Tecuceanu on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{jarman2020,\n  author = {{Ben Jarman} and Jarman, Ben},\n  title = {“…Even Roses Grow Out of Sh*t, Don’t They?”},\n  date = {2020-12-20},\n  url = {https://benjarman.uk/changing-inside/even-roses-grow.html},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBen Jarman, & Jarman, B.

    "text": "Selecting participants on tariff length\nOne thing that has been on my mind lately is how to select a sample of people to interview. I’ll be working in two different prisons, holding lifers early and late in the sentence. Analytical comparisons between people at different sentence stages are built into the research design.\nHowever, within each prison, I also want to compare people who have been given bigger and smaller tariffs, for murders the law sees as more and less blameworthy. Tariff length is at best only a very crude way of making moral distinctions between different offences, but I’m working on the basis that comparisons on this variable will be meaningful in shaping people’s experience of the sentence.\nCrude or not, one reason to do so is that lifers themselves use the tariff as the basis for moral comparisons. As the quotation below from my pilot research in 2017 suggests, the fact that these comparisons can end up feeling quite futile doesn’t mean it’s easy to refrain from making them:\n\nInterviewee: It’s like, down at work, there’s four of us, all doing [X] year [tariffs]. One geezer […] stabbed an old man to death. Another one killed his girlfriend. And another one [killed someone] in a wheelchair […] [X] years, [X] years, [X] years. And it’s like, “right, you took a knife to this bloke’s house, killed him. You killed your missus, with a knife. You [killed someone] in a wheelchair. I [killed someone in self-defence]. How the fuck have I ended up with [X] years?” You start relating [your sentence] to people’s… you end up… It’s pointless… it’s like… “mine’s bigger than yours.”\nMe: Are you saying it’s best not to go there?\nInterviewee: Sometimes. Or you use humour. You laugh it off. I know that’s sad, but that’s life.\nExtract from an interview with ‘Richard’\n\nA brief digression: first, to say that ‘X’ marks the actual tariff length, edited out to preserve Richard’s anonymity and confidentiality (his name has also been changed); and second, to say that he was appealing his conviction, and maintained that self-defence rendered his conviction undeserved. Since I had no way to evaluate his very strong feelings of injustice, I won’t try to do so here."

    "text": "Spurious comparions?\nRichard’s comparisons remind us that ‘murder’ is a broad legal category, despite its weighty connotations of seriousness, violence, and irreversible harm. In the law of England and Wales, there is only a single offence of murder (there are no ‘degrees’ of murder, as there are in many other countries). A murder can take place in a very wide range of circumstances: a carer administering euthanasia, an intimate partner retaliating after years of abuse, a contracted assassination, a dispute with a criminal rival, a sadistic serial killing, a fight with unenvisaged (and perhaps unintended) consequences. Some of these scenarios are rare, and there are certainly more and less ‘typical’ murders, but few would agree that all are morally equivalent. Richard certainly didn’t.\nIndeed, the law also distinguishes between murders it holds to represent different levels of seriousness and culpability. Since the life sentence is mandatory, these distinctions in blameworthiness can only be reflected by altering the minimum term of imprisonment to be served during a life sentence (the ‘tariff’). The tariff is, in theory, the ‘punishment’ part of a life sentence: a retributive penalty reflecting the lifer’s culpability as seen by the courts."

After the tariff, if they remain in prison, it is (in theory) not for punishment, but to incapacitate them: to protect the public from the risk of harm that they are believed to pose, risk which cannot be managed in the community.\nAt this stage (still in theory) they are being punished not for what they have done in the past (because the punishment part of the sentence ended with the expiry of the tariff), but for what they might do in the future (because their continued imprisonment is based on the assessment of risk).\nIn a very small number of cases, the offence is deemed to be so serious that at the outset, the person is told that they must be imprisoned for the rest of their natural life (a ‘whole life tariff’). But for most, a tariff in years is set. Parole becomes possible (though not certain) after that number of years. Obtaining it depends on satisfactory performance against rehabilitative targets and sentence plans which are set by prison staff. In theory, tariffs of the same number of years convey an equivalent degree of censure.\nIt can be summed up, and somewhat simplified, using the following diagram:\n\n\n\ndiagram showing the structure of a life sentence\n\n\nThough it looks neat and tidy in theory, in reality the picture is messier. There are many reasons why, with consequences for how people think about their sentences. I’ll say more about them in the second part of this post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

    "text": "I am a Research Fellow at the University of Southampton, where I joined the Law School in December 2024. My research to date has focused on long-term imprisonment and its broader implications for prisoners, the penal system, and for criminal justice in the UK more generally.\nI am interested by how people cope, and survive, when they are facing lengthy or lifelong punishment after a serious conviction. Partly, this is a question relating to the practical and emotional challenges of imprisonment, though this is well explored by existing research. What is less thoroughly researched is the moral dimensions of extreme sentences: the claim that they communicate society’s disapproval of the index offence, while conveying to the person convicted that they deserve to suffer for their actions, and ought to change. An interest in how people respond to this message has been a consistent thread in my research career.\n\nMy doctorate, completed in 2024 at the Cambridge Prisons Research Centre was jointly funded by UKRI and Quakers in Britain. It investigated the ethical experiences in prison of men serving mandatory life sentences for murder, exploring how they make sense of their situation and attempted to construct positive identities in an unpromising setting.\nBuilding on this foundation, my current work at Southampton explores the purpose and future of parole in England & Wales. It explores the intersections between the sociology of prisons and punishment, moral philosophy (specifically, penal theory), and criminal law. As well as publishing my PhD, I plan to conduct new empirical research on parole decision-making, and to develop plans for a larger quantitative study on the same topic.\n\nI welcome contact and am interested in building networks at Southampton and beyond. If you find what I’m doing interesting and want to make contact, please get in touch and introduce yourself."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s hard to believe five years have passed since 29th November 2019, when everything changed for me and many others with the murders of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at a Learning Together event at Fishmongers Hall in London. Today is a very similar day—cold, crisp, stark winter sunshine—and perhaps for this reason, other memories of the day feel fresh.\nEach anniversary has been difficult in its own way. The first two I dreaded for weeks beforehand, in what I now recognise as a post-traumatic state of agitation. The day still lived vividly and bodily in me then, with the ordeal of the inquest and its media circus either imminent or still recent. The third and fourth anniversaries felt less daunting. As the hiatus of the pandemic lifted, so life began to move forwards again. By the third anniversary, I was in a new job and we were expecting our first baby; by the fourth, he was here. Last year was the first time the anniversary stole up on me, instead of looming in my thoughts weeks ahead.\nNow, half a decade on, the event feels both increasingly distant and surprisingly close. Distant, because life continues. We’re all getting older, but Jack (who I knew) and Saskia (who I didn’t) are not. That has a bittersweet taste, but just as long-term prisoners describe finding it hard to relate to family members who are amassing different life experiences to them, so it is with growing older. In my mid-twenties, two close friends—contemporaries of mine, unlike Jack, who was much younger than me—both died. Devastating as that was at the time, it’ll be twenty years next year since they went. Those of us left are living into new lives, where our departed friends might not fully recognise us. Life goes on.\nAnd yet despite all this increasing distance, the day itself, and its aftermath, also now seems very close. Life since has been lived in its shadow. Partly this was circumstantial—the inquest and my PhD made it impossible simply to ‘change the subject’.1 Partly, it was relational—close friendships formed through Learning Together were tested by different reactions to trauma, and not all of them remain. In addition, at the time, both mine and my wife’s work involved prisons, leaving us both with questions about safety and whether to continue.2 Social isolation during the pandemic made brooding easier, and experiencing Learning Together’s slow dissolution proved as devastating as the original incident.\n1 The day before the attack, I had finished the first phase of the research, interviewing men serving life sentences for murder at a category-B prison. I finally finished the PhD earlier this year.2 Just over a week before, she had helped the London Jazz Festival put on a concert in the chapel at HMP Wormwood Scrubs. I wasn’t there, to my regret. A short video highlight is here, and the full audio is here. I rediscovered both recently: they’re fantastic.Mostly, though, this year, the event feels close because I’ve been writing and thinking about it with the benefit of hindsight and distance. I dislike the cliché that “time heals all”, which cheapens loss and neglects its gnarlier byways. The aftermath of Fishmongers Hall serves as a reminder: some harms aren’t mended, some wrongs go unresolved, and some damage can’t be repaired. It’s a hard world, and sometimes smaller consolations are all that’s available.\nBut with time, wounds become scars, and scars grow less livid. My feelings have evolved similarly, and what I have to say about what happened feels more coherent than it used to. The incident brought into sharp focus what’s at stake in the aftermath of violence. Some of the resulting thinking went into my lecture to British Quakers this July; more will go into an associated book I’m working on now; and a book from the PhD will hopefully follow in 2025 or 2026. There’s now a sharp ‘before’ and ‘after’ in my life and my career, and the questions I’m left with are live and productive.\nToday I revisited Jack’s father Dave’s short article about him, published in The Guardian three days after his death. Dave reflected on Jack’s outrage at how we punish in this country. His piece felt at the time like a powerful intervention in that year’s general election campaign. I vividly remember sitting in the Granta in Cambridge, with mutual friends of Jack’s and mine, the night before publication. They had seen the piece, and I remember their pride in how well it captured Jack’s essence.\nI sensed then—mistakenly—that the piece, and the terrible event which led to it, would impact the politics of punishment for the better. That hope was wishful, as well as mistaken. Five years on, we’re deeper into the dysfunction that the last two or three decades of penal policy have bequeathed. A newish government might at last have recognised that many problems relate to sentences themselves and not merely how they are carried out.\nI’m cautiously hopeful for what might come from the associated review of sentencing: there are some good people working on the review, though the politics around the policy remain challenging.\nBut whatever its outcome, and however misplaced my earlier hopes for change, today I want to remember the Jack I knew, so well captured in his dad’s words:\n\nWhat Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens. That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{jarman2024,\n  author = {{Ben Jarman}},\n  title = {Remembering {Fishmongers} {Hall}},\n  date = {2024-11-29},\n  url = {https://benjarman.uk/blog/fishmongers-hall-five-years.html},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBen Jarman.

Other posts will specifically be written for the blog, but these notes posts are a way of trying to force myself into some writing, and also to share some of what I’m doing.\nThis is on an article I’ve re-read recently, which sets out an agenda for far greater attention by criminologists and policymakers to the needs of long-term prisoners. The citation is at the end.\nKazemian and Travis set out the case that there should be a far greater attention to long-term and life-sentenced prisoners as a group. Their argument particularly draws on the US context, but is relevant to the UK as well, because of the high numbers of lifers that we imprison."

    "text": "Lifers and long-termers as a largely ignored group\nThe case made here is that long-termers and lifers have been ‘largely ignored’ (p.357) as a group when it comes to research on desistance from crime. Some of the reasons for this are technical, and are connected with how hard it is to design longitudinal research that can follow people for long enough as well as controlling for the effects of what are often very different prison environments.\nBut Kazemian and Travis argue that the other reasons for the neglect of long-term prisoners are political. Because lengthy prison sentences are often assumed to be given to the ‘worst of the worst’ offenders, who are unpopular and lack any form of representation, the needs of long-sentenced prisoners have been easy to ignore and sideline, and have tended therefore to be a low political priority. Moreover, it is widely noted among prison administrators and researchers that the majority of lifers are highly compliant, adding to the impression that their needs can be forgotten. As a result, there is a dearth of interventions specifically addressing their needs, and those which are available sometimes fail to recognise what is unusual about their situation, and how they may have become quite different people to when they were first imprisoned, without a great deal of deliberate rehabilitative input from the prison authorities. This last point rings very true for me, tallying with what I was told by a couple of the men I interviewed in 2017 while doing my pilot research for this project."

    "text": "What is the current state of research?\nMost of the major studies of long-term prisoners as a group are out of date: they were conducted in the 1970s and 80s, mostly in the US and the UK. These studies are of limited help when it comes to thinking about imprisonment today: although they offer some pointers about the effects of imprisonment on the individual, imprisonment itself has changed: prisons are usually more overcrowded, larger, and more ethnically and culturally diverse, sentences are longer, and the expectations placed on prisoners different. Despite its limitations, the available research offers some pointers, suggesting that long-term and life-sentenced prisoners, as a group:\n\nface distinctive challenges and have distinctive needs, arising from the fact that such a large part of their life will be spent in prison, distorting the ‘normal’ life course\npose no greater risk of harm to others (either within prison or after release) than short-term prisoners\nreoffend at far lower rates than short-term prisoners\n\nIn addition, it appears that:\n\nlonger sentences don’t result in better outcomes, with time served a poor predictor of recidivism\nmost long-termers find imprisonment very difficult but find ways to cope\nthat the changes they undergo are poorly understood and may be unhelpful when it comes to life after release. Specifically, and in general:\npeople get less dangerous as they get older\nthis does not mean they are well-prepared for life after prison; for that to happen, prison regimes have to be deliberately planned towards that outcome\n\nThere is also good evidence, in general, that some prison environments are more harmful than others. A well-run prison can achieve better outcomes, but a negative one can make it far harder to survive, with bad prisons significantly increasing outcomes such as suicide, violence and self-harm."

    "text": "Are prisons good? Or bad? Or something else?\nFor me some of the most interesting parts of the case that Kazemian and Travis put forward relate to how we evaluate imprisonment as a whole. There are two distinct points here.\nFirst, in the US, at least, the debate over mass incarceration has hampered our understanding of how to make prisons better places. Two antagonistic ways of looking at prisons have taken hold:\n\none emphasises that prisons incapacitate dangerous people for a period of time, and thereby benefit everyone else outside\nanother emphasises that prisons don’t reduce reoffending as much as other interventions, and thereby fail to benefit everyone else outside\n\nThe authors point out that these are both valid positions but each answers a rather different question. As a result, the debate has hardened into two opposed camps emphasising different evaluations, and thus has become bogged down in polarised debate over whether prisons are either ‘good’ or ‘bad’. In fact, neither position captures the intricacies of how people experience their sentences, nor the complexity of the consequences. More importantly, the antagonistic nature of the debate limits understanding of how to achieve better outcomes. This is especially important in the case of long-term imprisonment for serious offences, when the available alternatives to imprisonment are few or none."

    "text": "But do long prison sentences work?\nSecond, Kazemian and Travis argue that both of the views above are really questions about how the wider community does or does not benefit from imprisonment, and say nothing of the prisoner’s experience. For example, in focusing too narrowly on reoffending rates and other outcomes after release, we risk endorsing the view that these are the only outcomes that matter. They measure only whether imprisonment benefits the wider community, not whether it might benefit (or harm) long-term prisoners themselves, in ways that are slow, incremental and less straightforward to observe, nor whether these individual-level changes benefit or harm others:\n\n“A recidivism-focused approach disregards changes and progress exhibited in other behavioral, cognitive, and social outcomes. Studies have found that criminal careers are characterized by a great deal of intermittency, and several researchers have acknowledged the relevance of perceiving desistance [from crime] as a gradual process” (p. 377)\n\nAnother to think about this is to ask whether the ends always justify the means. If lifers seldom reoffend, but they were kept in prison longer than was necessary to achieve that outcome, and meanwhile their families and communities suffered by their absence, does that matter?\nKazemian and Travis point out that this question gains particular purchase in the context of the US imprisonment binge of the last 40 years: the impacts on ethnic and racial minority communities of mass imprisonment have been disastrous, and most of those harmed committed no offence. They quote research by Johnson and McGunigall-Smith, who conclude that lifers are:\n\n‘manageable prisoners, [even] model prisoners, but their decent adjustment does not change the fact that their lives are marked by suffering and privation.’ (quoted p.383)"

    "text": "Thankful for one’s imprisonment?\nThe idea that the debate on prisons has become narrow and polarised rings true to me. The dualistic view doesn’t tally with the complexity of what I have heard from lots (though not all) of the long-term prisoners I’ve met over the years: that for all that being in prison has been bad, it’s somehow enabled positive change. Here is one of the men I interviewed for my MPhil research:\n\n‘I have to thank [prison], in a way […] This place has changed a lot since I came here seven years ago, not all for the best, mostly it’s just down, but… [long pause] This place changed me, you know? I have emotional ties here. I will always be thankful. It is like a dysfunctional home to me.’\n‘David’ (not his real name)\n\nThis definitely does not represent everyone’s experience of long-term imprisonment, but it is some people’s, and that matters. I think the ‘I will always be thankful’ has to be taken seriously. I also think that this is not the same as saying imprisonment is a good thing (or that it works, or that we should have more of it). It recognises that, at least in the case of serious offences, imprisonment has been an unavoidable response to serious harm, and that in these circumstances it might make sense to try and ensure that it does no more harm in return than is necessary. ‘David’ certainly seemed to me to mean what he said, and from what he said it also seemed that he had coped and adapted well. It should also be noted, however, that he was relatively near to the end of his sentence. Whether, in a few years’ time and with the benefit of future hindsight, he would have said the same after release is another question."

They argue that prisons should make long-term planning of this kind part of the sentence plan, rather than leaving sentence planning to work on the same basis as it does for shorter sentences.\nThey go on to say that it’s possible that this may already be happening, that in other words:\n\n‘long termers and lifers are already contributing to the enhancement of the prison community, but to our knowledge, virtually no data (other than anecdotal) exist to verify this claim’ (p.372)\n\nMy hunch, based my experience working in prisons, and also on some recent research I’ve read, is that a lot of the social interactions in which long-termers could be exercising leadership in this way occur in the everyday social life of the prison: on the wings, in the workshops, in education classrooms, and so on, and not just in formal, officially-organised rehabilitative interventions such as offending behaviour courses. This means that significant amounts of personal change could be taking place in the same locations, but that how this happens is not well understood. This is the kind of ground-level research question that ethnographic research is good at illuminating."

It goes without saying that it’s a reformist rather than an abolitionist position regarding imprisonment itself, and I think it needs to be coupled with due interest and regard to what lifers themselves want from prison regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImage credit: Scott Graham via Unsplash"

    "section": "Confused messages",
    "text": "Confused messages\nSecond, some empirical research (Schinkel 2014) shows that the moral messages supposedly sent by imprisonment get lost in transmission. For one thing, long-term prisoners often can’t remember what judges said at sentencing hearings that happened long ago, and where in any case they were emotionally overwhelmed by the verdict and the severity of the sentence. For another, even if they do remember the sentencer’s remarks, there is no guarantee that they see them as legitimate or agree with the version of events on which they comment, as Richard’s example makes clear.\nMore fundamentally, however, sentencers are not the only ones who send a moral message. The way prisoners are treated often carries its own messages about worth and standing, as one oft-quoted passage argues:\n\n‘every instance of brutality in prisons, every casual racist joke and demeaning remark, every ignored petition, every unwarranted bureaucratic delay, every inedible meal, every arbitrary decision to segregate or transfer without giving clear and well-founded reasons, every petty miscarriage of justice, every futile and inactive period of time—is delegitimating.’\n(Sparks and Bottoms 1995:60)\n\nSimilar messages can be implicit in the way that rehabilitation is organised and delivered: if you were knocked back repeatedly in numerous parole hearings without understanding why, or could not access interventions which were a precondition of release in your sentence plan, you might find official claims to be interested in your rehabilitation somewhat hollow. Similarly, if part of the ‘message’ of a conviction is that your past actions were wrongful and that you have to ‘take responsibility’ for ensuring that they don’t occur again in future, what this might mean in practice is open to interpretation, and shaped by who has the power to define the terms of the argument. Because some lifers get very confused and frustrated by the power imbalances involved here, it has been argued (by Crewe 2011, for example) that the life sentence involves particular pains—of indeterminacy, of psychological assessment, of being minutely observed and impelled to govern oneself."

What you get from the experience—misery or motivation, depression or development—will depend on how you think about the punishment that society has imposed on you, and the society itself. If you feel it was deserved, and you have been been treated fairly, your prison experience might still be unpleasant. But it would still be different compared to how it would if you felt humiliated, traduced or mistreated. Such wider views of punishment draw on a complex blend of feelings about the offence, feelings about the conviction and the sentence, and feelings about one’s prison experiences."

    "text": "The wrong tool for fine distinctions?\nAs Richard’s words (quoted in the first post) suggested, a given number of years is a very blunt and forceful measure of moral censure. Here is a short extract again:\n\nOne geezer […] he stabbed an old man to death. Another one killed his girlfriend. And another one [killed someone] in a wheelchair […] [X] years, [X] years, [X] years. And it’s like, “right, you took a knife to this bloke’s house, killed him. You killed your missus, with a knife. You [killed someone] in a wheelchair. I [killed someone in self-defence].” How the fuck have I ended up with [X] years?\n‘Richard’\n\nAs far as Richard is concerned, identical sentences had been passed on offences that were not morally equivalent. He saw that as unfair. It is significant that he made his point by referring to the identity (and presumably by extension the vulnerability) of the victims in each case. Far from simply being a self-serving comparison or a minimisation of blame (though some might read it thus), this moral distinction between different victims is built into the law, as one of many reference points for where to set the penalty. I’ll write more about these aspects of the law soon.\nAlso as Richard suggested, the aims of the sentence have to be seen in the context of its sheer length. He was a few years into his sentence, having been in his thirties at the time of the offence. By the time of release he would be nearly sixty. Sentences of this kind are life-changing, in the way that physical injuries are sometimes described as life-changing. If your life is irrevocably altered by punishment—if, for example, as some female lifers are, your imprisonment lasts until after you are biologically able to have children—there is no way that ‘rehabilitation’ can have its dictionary meaning of being ‘restored to former privileges’, even if you think that the punishment was deserved."

Without one, decades of imprisonment might represent a meaningless and futile waste of life, something painful to consider and difficult to live through.\nIn this context, claims that the sentence will be in some way rehabilitative might seem hard to believe. Likewise, meeting rehabilitative targets might feel less attractive, if you can’t find a way to square their aims with your own priorities. Some lifers express sentiments ranging from weariness to outright cynicism about the ‘box-ticking’ of the sentence plan and its targets. Richard declined to engage with it or to participate in any offending behaviour courses, because (in his own eyes) he was not as culpable as the sentence declared him to be. Not only could he see no way to relate sentence targets to his own concerns; worse, rehabilitation itself seemed futile in view of the sheer gravity of his murder conviction. As he put it:\n\n‘How can you become a better person once you’ve been sentenced for murder? […] There’s a lad down at work, he’s been on all the courses going, and he’s still the biggest racist, sexist idiot I know. [He’ll go] “yeah, I just bloody blagged that course, yeah, I just bloody blagged that course, yeah, just tell them what they want to hear”. I could be doing that now with you!

For Richard, a murder conviction and a sentence measured in decades conferred such massive stigma that it was difficult to imagine ‘becom[ing] a better person once you’ve been sentenced for murder’. He evaluated rehabilitative courses not on their narrow promise (reducing specified risks of harm), but on the basis that they had failed to enact a wider moral transformation (‘he’s still […] racist [and] sexist’) of the kind that might presumably legitimate such a severe sanction.\nIt appeared that contemplating the sheer number of prison years ahead overwhelmed any desire Richard might have had to compromise with the rehabilitative goals the prison set for him. Moreover, the fact that any chance of parole was still very distant meant that he saw little reason to change his stance—yet.\nIn writing up the pilot research I called this position ‘rehabilitative procrastination’, and I wonder now whether it’s likely to be a consequence of the ever-increasing length of tariffs that have been handed down since 2003. Those increases, and the reasons they have happened, will be the subject of a future post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

It used mixed methods – a survey and in-depth interviews – and is therefore both a qualitative and a quantitative analysis. It was of significant size: 818 people in England and Wales — 789 men and 29 women — matched the research criteria, and a total of 310 men and 23 women participated in the study by survey and/or interview.\nThere was one significant gap: 191 people from that total of 818 (24%) could not participate because they had been transferred from prisons into secure psychiatric hospitals. The size of this group really took me aback: it represents people who for one reason or another failed to cope in prison. The researchers point out that this means their findings on how people adapt to imprisonment are limited to those who did cope."

    "text": "How to measure the effects of imprisonment?\nResearch attempting to assess the effects of long-term imprisonment has a long history. The most credible quantitative research has generally failed ‘to demonstrate a debilitating impact on such matters as cognitive functioning or self-esteem’ (Crewe et al 2017:520); meanwhile, qualitative research has given rich accounts of how prisoners struggle and experience subjective ‘pains of imprisonment’, but not in ways that are easy to generalise to long-term imprisonment in general.\nThis study has a mixed-methods approach and therefore a different perspective. Rather than using measures of such variables as reaction times, and then failing to demonstrate that long-term prisoners decline at a rate faster than anyone else, it uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to inquire into the problems that prisoners experience, and how severe they experience those problems to be. The starting assumption here is that the harms and pains of imprisonment, if they exist, lie in the realm of subjective experience. Designing the research in this way is a way of saying that if someone experiences subjective suffering (as opposed to measurable physical or neurological decline) then we should take that into account."

    "section": "The main findings",
    "text": "The main findings\n\nIt’s worst at the beginning**\nFirst, the problems of long-term imprisonment are distinctly worse in the early stages of sentences. They are also gendered, in the sense that they are qualitatively different and more severe for women as opposed to men. For those in the early stages of life sentences, there are a number of challenges:\n\n‘entry shock’ – being plunged into very unfamiliar circumstances and torn away from one’s regular social world\n‘temporal vertigo’ – intense disorientation and distress arising from thinking about a prison sentence that is often nearly equal in length to one’s age at sentencing\n‘intrusive recollections’ – symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder relating to one’s own involvement in the offence\n\nIt’s noted that most lifers didn’t feel they received a great deal of support with these three problems, or know where they could turn for help. Many were concerned about burdening loved ones outside prison who in any case were hard to contact; others found it hard to trust anyone in what was an unfamiliar and often frightening environment; and some found it hard to seek help or sympathy for difficulties they believed they had inflicted upon themselves. It was especially hard for those who had maintained their innocence throughout the trial process, or were appealing their conviction.\nAs a consequence, there is a distinctive pattern of adaptation and coping among lifers in the early years of their sentences, characterised by a ‘backward-looking’ outlook which emphasises (even grieves for) the past, This mindset suppresses thoughts of the future, denies the reality of the new situation, or redirects such difficult feelings into such endeavours as art and education. A particular characteristic at this stage is the refusal to think too far ahead, and a tendency to live in the immediate present, because one’s perceptions of time are so distorted by the boredom and unfamiliarity of prison.\n\n\nComing to terms with the offence\nSecond, the authors argue that for most of the lifers they interviewed, adaptation to imprisonment and moving forward in life involved coming to terms with (and accepting some measure of responsibility for) the offence. Here, the finality of homicide (the offence committed by all those in this study) is particularly significant, and difficult to deal with. Lifers coming to terms with their sentence need to find ways to acknowledge responsibility without becoming swamped by guilt, because they cannot simply put right the harm that has been done.\nAs the authors put it, this involves ‘taking moral responsibility, while also recognising the futility of being hobbled by what was in the past’ (Crewe et al. 2017: 530):\n\nHe shouldn’t have died, his family shouldn’t have felt the grief […] But, at the same time, there’s nothing I can do, so I can’t carry this burden with me for the rest of my life because there’s nothing that I can do. I can’t feel sorry that I’m not in my daughter’s life, I can’t feel sorry that I wasn’t there for my mum or my gran […] when they were grieving. […] There’s nothing that I can do for [his family]. And with acceptance is when I come to terms with it.\n‘Julius’ (not his real name)\n\nIt was also clear that this process of acceptance was very much more difficult for those who continued to feel their conviction was mistaken or illegitimate, with the complexities and injustices of the law around Joint Enterprise highlighted by the research as a significant problem.\nAnother interesting element here is that many of the prisoners quoted linked the consequences of their offence for their victim(s) with the consequences of their sentences for their own loved ones. This makes clear that feelings of guilt are not merely associated with the offence itself, but with the impact of the sanction as well, so that a lifer can feel very guilty about not being there for loved ones even if they harbour doubts about some aspects of their conviction. This rings very true for some of the interviews I did in my own pilot research for this PhD, which I’ll write about another time.\n\n\nTime and the sentence\nSecond, adapting to a very long prison sentence involves reframing one’s attitude to time, and also rethinking the relevance of one’s life before prison. The authors argue that most lifers eventually come to recognise the realities of their predicament, namely that prison is the only place where, for the time being, life can be lived. This means the relevance of one’s markers of identity and status before prison recedes. For example, it is more difficult to fulfil the expectations that go with one’s social ties before prison. Children grow, friends lose contact, and the life-sentenced prisoner’s focus turns more and more inward, to gleaning what can be got from the sentence itself.\nThis shifting attitude to time was observed in a marked tendency for lifers in the study who were further into their sentences to think and talk about the future (rather than to deliberately fix their attention on the present and the past). It was also evident in their tendency to describe what they had control over, despite the obvious constraints of the prison environment, rather than to focus on how little control they possessed over their own lives:\n\nQ: Do you feel that you’ve got control of your life in here, or control of certain aspects of your life?\nA: I’ve got control of certain aspects. […] I’ve got control in […] how I react to people, and how I interact with people [and] my plans for the future and getting myself prepared and ready for that. I’ve got certain control over my education and I’ve got certain control over staying healthy, and staying ﬁt, staying positive.\n‘Daniel’ (not his real name)\n\nThe authors argue that this process of adaptation was remarkably consistent across their whole sample of lifers (though as I noted above, it may not apply to the significant minority who fail to cope and end up in psychiatric care). For most, it arises from the recognition that there is literally no alternative to living life in the constrained circumstances of prison, and that the conditions and circumstances of one’s life beforehand recede in importance.\nIn the next post I’ll note what I think are the questions raised by these studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

I said I’d ask around, and come back to him with anything I found out, provided the prison agreed to it.\nResearchers in prisons are not allowed to offer incentives to their participants, and seen from one perspective what I’d agreed to was something like one. The interaction I described in the first post of this pair strayed beyond the boundaries set for it, and the ‘rules of the game’ were somewhat undermined.\nYet I could see nothing obviously wrong with providing (if I could find one) a recommendation for good services to engage with in future. Quite the opposite. But where it involves a default, taken-for-granted power relationship—in which he is the subordinate recipient of services, rather than the active seeker of them—being challenged or subverted, things get uncomfortable.\nWas I being ‘manipulated’ by a ‘powerful criminal figure’, or was I responding as I would to any minor request for help from someone with whom I’d had a long conversation, gaining some sympathy for his point of view? Almost imperceptibly, and in a way that only became clear later, different rules had been negotiated than those which applied by default. This ability—to make evaluations and reach agreements about the right way of doing things—is intrinsic to a great deal of social interaction.

He wouldn’t accept a position in the conversation which was not dominant. It undermined the unspoken rules (such as turn-taking or relevance) that allow conversations to flow smoothly.\nAnthropologist Webb Keane’s brilliant 2016 book, Ethical Life, points out that it’s from these unspoken rules of interaction that we often unconsciously and habitually draw ethical inferences about other people. This is why we often feel a quite specifically moralised anger—why, on some level, it hurts and feels like we have been wronged—when someone we are speaking with seems not to be paying attention to us, or refuses to observe small rules of conduct that convey respect, or otherwise communicates what we take to be disdain, haughtiness or condescension. When, in other words, they don’t treat us as equals.\nKeane’s point is that body language, non-verbal cues and other tiny symbols of this sort often do a lot of ethical work, as well as simply facilitating interaction. Most of the time, we hardly think about them, but sometimes we do ponder what they mean. That pondering sometimes leads unspoken rules to be questioned, and leads people to make conscious steps to resist norms that seem self-evidently good to others, because they have arrived at a different understanding of what they mean.\nThe early Quakers famously did exactly this when they refused to take off their hats to greet people, or to use the honorific ‘you’ (rather than the familiar ‘thou’) when addressing their elders and social ‘superiors’. For them, these actions were a way of testifying to the equality before God of all people, regardless of social rank; but their actions seemed strange and rude to those in 17th-century England who were more invested in such manners. These were not trivial matters: there are recorded examples of Quakers’ refusal to toe the interactional line leading to their being beaten and imprisoned, so powerfully did they offend their contemporaries.\nSimilarly, today, people who want to highlight (and end) the exclusion and marginalisation of transgender people will include their favoured pronouns in email signatures and Twitter profiles.\nWe make a huge amount, in everyday life, of tiny cues such as these, using them as what Keane calls ‘ethical affordances’—signs we see as ethically relevant in evaluating someone, and which we put to use for this reason. Prison researchers, for example, have sometimes noted that in some prisons, prison officers are uncomfortable using prisoners’ first names or with being addressed by prisoners using their own first names. Perhaps this upsets their sense of their own authority, which is simultaneously formal and based in law, and yet also always fragile, contested, and contingent."

I will still leave the prison armed with my consent form, along with certain personal data relating to him and his sentence, my notes on the interview, and notes on certain aspects of his prison file. Unless he writes to the address on the participant information sheet by the prescribed date to say that he wishes to withdraw his consent, I will anonymise these records, hold them on file, and retain them as records showing I have acted ethically towards him. On that basis, I can justifiably proceed to treat his words as ‘research data’, analyse them, and write them up as part of my PhD. To that extent, the relationship is still vertical, with me in a position of power over him. The wider context of the relationship can still be criticised as extractive.\nMove the frame, though, and my experience of these interviews reversed some of this dynamic. I’m not sure whether he was in a position of power over me. The wider structural context makes it a ridiculous idea: he is black, I am white; he in prison, me at an elite university; and so on. But turning to the interaction itself, it definitely did not feel that I held power over him. He wouldn’t accept the subordinate role of being guided through my questions, and the interaction felt more horizontal than vertical. This both pushed me into bending the ordinary boundaries of the interaction by negotiating with him (by agreeing to write up more extensive notes on the interview than usual, and by deciding to ask around about mentoring services). Furthermore, at least in the tighter confines of the second interview, the interaction shaded into verticality, and left me feeling unequal and disadvantaged, because at times I felt stupid and disdained for asking such silly questions. This feeling, of something more like powerlessness, persisted, even when the questions themselves were utterly straightforward and factual."

    "text": "Making sense of slow progress?\nAnd this feeling of being on the wrong end of verticality—though it was fleeting and paradoxical—made tantalising sense of what he had said in the first interview about his struggles to make progress through his sentence.\nHe said that for years he had followed the expectations set out for him: completing courses, acting as a mentor, keeping out of trouble, and so on. Yet he had been knocked back in official evaluations, again and again. He could see no plausible explanation for this beyond (at best) official cynicism and (at worst) racist conspiracy, which labelled him ‘manipulative’, ‘powerful’, a ‘kingpin’, a ‘gangster’, and so on. He felt he was playing by the rules of the game. And his lack of progression discredited not him, but the rules themselves, and those he took as their representatives.\nI wondered whether the answer might lie in the nature of his interactions with other people. Many prison personnel would certainly have interviewed him in similar contexts to this over the years.\nWhat if his refusal to accept a subordinate role in an interview—to behave with the “proper” respect to those who are “in power”—is also how he has interacted with prison staff? What if, like me, they found their power challenged, felt inclined to make accommodations for him, but then reflected on the relevant rules and policies, concluding that they were accountable for upholding them? If so, then the explanation for his slow progress might have been less deliberately malign, yet simultaneously more insidious.\nIf so, then his requests might not seem reasonable or self-interested ones. Instead, he might seem manipulative, powerful, subversive, capable of getting ‘under the skin’ of staff. What he sought from me (favourable recognition, useful information) are ordinary things that people seek in their interactions with one another. They also, I think, represent exactly the kind of reformative agency that prisoners are supposed to display. But they don’t pay lip service to the power disparity of the prison context, nor respect ‘the rules’ for the interaction, nor leave those who are “supposed” to hold power easy and comfortable in their position."

Keane helped me see that I might be extending this into an ethical (and barely conscious) evaluation of him as a person.\nYet on further reflection, I could find no reason to connect rudeness (as I experienced it) with dangerousness or risk. Are manners a legitimate thing for a democratic state—which is not a nanny, or a finishing school—to try and reform? Are they a legitimate target for rehabilitative effort, or just a matter of class preference?\nCould it be that despite his longstanding clean record, and his fulfilment of every target set for his progression, this man had been held back because others with power found him rude, because they sensed he wouldn’t tip the hat to their rank? If so, what would that mean for the legitimacy of their power, and his ongoing punishment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

    "text": "Earlier this year I was involved in a project at a high-security prison. Each week a group of students from my university went into the prison to hear a course of lectures alongside a group of students resident in the prison. You can read more about the project here. I think it was around the fourth week of the course that something surprising happened: the students who lived in the prison began to turn up to the classes with cakes, which they had baked to share in the tea break after each lecture, before our small group discussions began. The sharing of cake continued for the remainder of the course, with the cakes getting more and more elaborate over time. A little bit of competition crept in, with some of the men from different wings trying to outdo one another: cakes topped with tinned mango and pineapple, profiteroles, lemon drizzle—you name it. It was a welcome and unexpected addition to the course experience, and it restored a certain normality to our days in the prison, each of which began with queueing to be frisked, searched, and led through gates and heavy doors on the way in."

    "text": "Is anything actually surprising here?\nOn one level, there’s nothing unusual about food being prepared and shared with guests: it’s a key element of hospitality and sociability, and really quite an unremarkable thing. Even so, I was surprised. Not just that the cakes had been made: long-term prisons often have cooking facilities, though I also appreciated that laying on that quantity of baking represented a significant material outlay for the men: prison work is not well-paid by outside standards and they had been buying the ingredients themselves. Instead, what really surprised—and impressed—me was that the prison had given permission for the cakes to be brought all the way from the wings to the classroom. In all the time I’ve worked in prisons, I’ve never been welcomed with hospitality of this kind, and not, I suspect, because no one wanted to offer it.\nHigh-security prisons can be dangerous places, though very rarely for visitors like us. Some weeks, during the the usual ‘how-are-you’ conversations that preceded each lecture, some of the men described tensions and incidents on the wings. These descriptions were a useful reminder that whatever was happening in the classroom, this was still a prison: a challenging, difficult place to live. Mistrust and suspicion are to a certain extent institutionalised, often for good reason. Quite apart from the fact that the cakes were pretty good to eat, it impressed me that someone in the prison had decided to recognise the baking as an ethical practice—an attempt to realise values of hospitality and conviviality, and of treating guests well—rather than to forbid it as a potentially crafty attempt to smuggle out contraband or manipulate the naïve university students."

    "text": "Too much security? Or the wrong kind?\nThat description of a certain security mindset might sound like an exaggeration, but it’s really not: risk aversion and security thinking, as well as being necessary, can also, if unchecked or unchallenged, lead to some bizarre situations, including the famous (to prison scholars!) example of a ‘subversive geranium’. It can also lead to outcomes that are subtly but profoundly dehumanising: a tendency to view everythingthat prisoners do as potentially risky, and consequently a situation in which quite normal human practices like hospitality or food-sharing are shut down on the grounds of potential danger.\nRyan Williams has written about this in relation to ‘prison Islam’—or as he pointedly calls it, Islamic piety. His research describes how certain visible markers of piety—such as beards, traditional Muslim dress, and so on—came to be read by prison authorities as evidence of potential radicalisation, and hence as a reason to treat those who bore them with greater-than-normal suspicion. It must be difficult to get out of these cycles of thinking. Prison culture often has strong them-and-us overtones: for a prisoner to be seen as too close to the staff can be costly (and the reverse can also be true). Normal human communication about the meaning of dress or beard-wearing can be difficult, and trust breaks down as a result. For prisoners, this can lead to the feeling that one is constantly watched but also constantly misrecognised: power feels very distant and uncaring, unerring suspicion of one’s attempts to be and do good feels like a slight, and keeping hope and making progress begin to seem impossible as the trap closes in. Extended over the decades-long sentences that serious offences mostly now attract, the effect can be counterproductive and feel illegitimate."

This question of ethics—of what it means to try and conceive of and live a ‘good life’, especially when you live under significant constraint—has become one of the major topics I’m interested in, and will be one of the things I’m thinking and writing about while I do my fieldwork.\nAnthropologists have done a lot of work in the last 15 or 20 years on how to study and make sense of ethics as an empirical phenomenon—that is, as a set of practices in the real world, rather than as a set of abstractions about what is the right thing to do in theory. Scholars in the field have tried to move away from the idea that morals are just preferences, with no greater importance for human behaviour than others such as preferred colour. They also insist that they can be studied in the real world, and subjected to rational discussion."

    "section": "Balancing competing values",
    "text": "Balancing competing values\nReading anthropological texts on this subject has helped sharpen my ideas about what to think and ask about when I’m doing my prison fieldwork. One key insight is that doing good means neither the “correct and deliberate following of rules”, nor* having “the courage or insight to ignore, subvert, transcend, or reinvent” rules (Lambek 2018: 139). Instead, it means having the capacity to recognise that sometimes rules and principles are in tension, and that different dimensions of value bear on the same issue. There are good reasons not to allow items like cakes to move around the prison; but applying these rules excessively can squash other things that are valuable too. Sometimes, this calls for rules to be challenged, bent, or suspended in favour of others, and that means ethical action also involves some degree of risk. In the suspicious environment described above, simply asking to bring a cake opens one to a degree of scrutiny; and permitting it to be brought cedes some amount of control over the way in which the class takes place. Ethics, then, involves a certain quality of practical judgment: having the capacity to choose, and to choose wisely, among the different sets of rules and principles and values that might apply to a given situation. Sometimes these judgments are habitual and automatic; sometimes they are deliberate and reflective; but always they are contestable and uncertain. We can’t always predict outcomes.\nWe all live with rules and constraints around us, and we all make judgments in relation to them all the time: prisons merely represent a place in which rules and constraints are present to an unusually intense degree. They are also places where disparities in power are enormous, and institutionalised. Being powerful or powerless doesn’t make you more or less ethical, however, and being ethical isn’t a static state: instead, you’re always in the process of becoming. Being mistaken, making decisions without access to all relevant facts, and getting things wrong are all more or less inevitable, which is why ethics can also sometimes be tragic: we can sometimes do wrong despite a sincere belief that we are doing right. Sometimes hindsight is not a wonderful thing at all. In the right conditions, though—if we can take for granted our basic safety and security, and if we’re able to reflect on ourselves—we can also learn, and re-evaluate ourselves, and perhaps even shape ourselves into something else than what we have been before."

    "section": "Returning to prisons",
    "text": "Returning to prisons\nBy now the relevance for prisons of this way of thinking should be clear. About prisons, we already have the empirical finding that long-term prisoners commonly take up conscious and deliberate projects of self-improvement, searching for a “cause, vocation or ideal” (Crewe et al., 2017: 537) that helps make prison life less monotonous and more meaningful. We also know that prisons which make it easier for prisoners to do this kind of work on the self—prisons which are physically safer places, and which use their power more legitimately—have significantly better outcomes: lower rates of suicide and self-harm, lower levels of distress, lower rates of reoffending. Readers familiar with criminology might also recognise some echoes from desistance research, particularly in the idea that people reflect on and reevaluate their values while subject to punishment.\nWhat I’ll be doing with this fieldwork is trying to zoom into how this all plays out at the micro-level of individual thought. I’ll be interviewing men serving life sentences in depth about what ‘being good’ means to them: whether it’s feasible; how they try to do it; how being convicted of different kinds of offence or serving time in different kinds of prison environments affects things; and whether and how ‘being good’ is recognised. It’s not just going to be a PhD about cake; but the example shows that cake (like many other things) can signify a lot more than just hospitality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis was originally posted as a Twitter thread and was reposted on the blog.\n\n\n\nI’m coding interviews. Today it’s someone I’ll call S. I’ve been thinking about something he said ever since I met him.\nI asked him to draw a timeline, representing the ups and downs of his time in prison. Usually, interviewees drew a zig-zagging line and described the highs and lows prompted by events inside and outside prison, how those events had made them feel, and so on. Most described the sentence as if it had some kind of meaning, whether positive, negative, or both. S, by contrast, drew a completely flat line across the top of the page, and then said:\n\nS: Well, it’s just a level line.\nBJ: Okay.\nS: I’ve been perfectly happy everywhere I’ve been in prison. I suppose I’m lucky in that I had massive support, family support. You know, I’ve enjoyed it. It must be… sound silly to say that.\nBJ: Unusual, maybe. I wouldn’t say silly.\nS: You see, I’ve met people in prison that I’ve never met in my life. And after I met people in prison… and [name] was one example, I may have mentioned him yesterday… A big, strong man from the north of England. Super chap, really, and clever. When he entered himself into quizzes on the wing, he used to win. Always knew the answers. I admired him enormously […] I used to sit at his table for lunch. There were four of us. We all sat together and I got to know them. And [name], he said, “[S]”, he said, “if you have any trouble, [S], in this prison, you come and tell me.” Well, I’ve never heard anybody say that to me anywhere before. But he realised I wasn’t as big as some of the others, I suppose. And he’d seen a bit of the world, one way and another. I’ve tried to write to him [since they moved me here].”\n\nS was in his eighties, and nearing the end of the sentence. He was slight, lively, self-deprecating, and engaging. He was in good health—he had taken up yoga in prison—and looked forward to going home. As he says here, his family and many others in his community had remained supportive, and he brought letters to show me that members of his home community had sent to express sympathy and support. He’s the most striking example of a small subgroup of maybe five people in my sample: people who haven’t much minded being in prison, even in one case describing the sentence as ‘like early retirement, really.’\n\nNot experiencing punishment as punishment\nGenerally, these men had been sentenced in late middle age or mature adulthood, and generally the murder conviction was their first and only. They didn’t describe feeling particular guilt or shame about the offence, and in the absence of previous convictions this usually meant they were seen by the prison as being a low risk of harm to others. Perhaps because the offence seemed such an aberration, they were also a low priority for rehabilitative intervention, and it appeared that the perception that they were not risky meant most had encountered little pushback to their justifications and minimisations regarding the offence itself (including from me, I have to admit: my job, as I saw it, was to listen, not challenge).\nNone denied that their actions had caused another’s death, but the question of blame seemed to have little bite for them. Most were financially secure (because they had had successful careers and owned property) and they expected to be able to meet their basic needs after release. And though some were sceptical about whether they would still be alive at the end of the sentence, they were mindful that if their health declined, the Prison Service would be responsible for their care.\nThe quote from S above gives some flavour of how prison had broadened his social horizons. Elsewhere in the interview, S recounted his time in a dispersal prison, when another prisoner—an organised crime figure – had described some of the elaborate creativity that went into drug importation. S’s face was alive with something like wonder when he was describing this. And it was also clear—both from his accounts, and from seeing his interactions with officers in the prison where I met him – that prison officers bent over backwards to accommodate his needs. For example, he liked to dress as men of his generation like to dress, including by wearing “proper” shoes, with a heel. He said that staff in one prison had made exceptions to ordinary dress rules, to enable him to do this. He had worked in highly trusted jobs and had clearly enjoyed the glimpse these had given him into the inner workings of the prisons where he’d done his time.\nIt didn’t surprise me that the staff liked him—I did too, since as well as being a convicted murderer he was also good company. But after the interview ended I was jolted out of this feeling of warmth, when he made some comments about black prisoners which were relatively mild, but unmistakably prejudiced and denigratory.\n\n\nWhat can we learn from S about punishment?\nWhy am I preoccupied by this one case? I think it shows how much the concepts we have for punishment work less well when the person being punished is not young.\n\nWhen I met him, S expected to be released soon and to go back home to “tend his garden” and live a quiet life—just what he said he’d have been doing anyway. His material security made this feasible, so concepts of ‘rehabilitation’ and ‘reform’ don’t work: what he saw as the meaningful changes in himself did not relate to his crime, and if anything related to the fact that prison had added a horizon-broadening coda to his life. He wasn’t trying to use the sentence to prepare for the future, and he didn’t particularly miss the things it was taking away.\nIt’s far from clear to me that he had experienced his time in prison as a punishment. He had a range of resources from his earlier life: personal charm; earlier experience (he compared the material privations of the sentence to childhood memories of post-war austerity and rationing, and evaluated the former as no real burden); familial support; and a broad racial, cultural and ethnic fit with many prison staff. He brought all of these to bear on the adaptive challenges of serving the sentence. They were not resources that all his younger counterparts shared.\nThe seeming absence of an obvious risk of reoffending, or of serious harm (I find it hard to imagine anyone less menacing). This seemed to mean that very little official effort had been made to communicate with him, morally speaking, about the harmfulness or wrongfulness of his offence. Of the documents I read, only the trial judge’s sentencing remarks did so, whereas S’s family and others support his view that he had been harshly dealt with. His rejection of moral judgement relating to the offence of murder was not uncommon in my sample. But with others, the perception of risk seemed to make it more likely that they would encounter official pushback on their attitudes about the offence they were in prison for. This seems a blind spot, if we think that punishment, by itself, communicates censure.\n\nPS. It’s important to note: these interviews were done before the pandemic, and S might or might not by now have been released. If not, COVID lockdowns will have drastically altered his experience, underlining how far his strengths were relational ones.\nhttps://unsplash.com/@scottwebb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImage from Scott Webb via Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{jarman2020,\n  author = {{Ben Jarman} and Jarman, Ben},\n  title = {“{I’ve} Been Perfectly Happy in Prison”},\n  date = {2020-11-27},\n  url = {https://benjarman.uk/changing-inside/perfectly-happy-in-prison.html},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBen Jarman, & Jarman, B.

It’s been prompted by reading Struggle for Justice, a report published by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC – a Quaker body) in the 1970s. Published at time when the accepted wisdom of the post-war period — which favoured rehabilitation as the proper aim for punishment — was coming under sustained challenge, the report makes a powerful case against rehabilitative theories of punishment.\nThis might seem surprising today, in the context of a criminal justice system that is often perceived as excessively punitive. In the last several years, for example, successive governments in England and Wales have promised a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ as a means of emptying out prisons. Regardless of whether this has been a success, the language is significant: ‘rehabilitation’ has a certain appeal, holding out the prospect of turning crime, a social ill, into better outcomes in the future. But the AFSC report sounds a note of caution about such language, for reasons that I think are of lasting interest."

    "text": "Quaker reformers and the aims of punishment\nWhy is this important? I am a Quaker, and Quakers in Britain are part-funding my research, so this is a matter of personal as well as academic interest. Quaker values are strongly egalitarian, and are often associated with a progressive, reformist, and occasionally a radical political agenda. Quaker reform efforts in criminal justice (especially prisons) have a long history, going back right to the very start of the Quaker movement.\nQuaker reform agendas have often grown out of the concern for what individual Quakers understood to be the welfare or betterment of prisoners and others subject to state punishment. It’s fair to note (albeit with the benefit of hindsight) that these agendas have had mixed degrees of success, with some turning out unworkable, and others having unforeseen consequences.\nFor example, Quakers in the US played their part in the birth of the modern prison as an institution. This invented a system of silence and isolation which was never fully realised, but which is the ancestor of today’s extended solitary confinement, now commonly held not to be reformative but harmful and cruel. One can debate the extent to which the Quakers were instrumental to the creation of the ‘silent system’, but the point here is that yesterday’s penal reforms can become today’s penal problems.\nStruggle for Justice appears very aware of this danger. This may in part be a consequence of its authorship. Among its authors, the name John Irwin grabbed my attention. He’s a major figure in prison sociology, and his last book, Lifers, published nearly 40 years later, has influenced recent studies including this one. Crucially, Irwin knew his field from personal experience, having served time in prison as a young man. I wonder how far his lived experience of the excesses of rehabilitation may have shaped the report’s cautious, minimal and sceptical approach to rehabilitative power."

    "section": "How does Struggle for Justice make its case?",
    "text": "How does Struggle for Justice make its case?\nThe AFSC report opens with a chapter setting out how the aims of punishment had changed since the early 19th century:\n\nDuring the last century the professed aims of criminal justice have changed from retribution to rehabilitation and preventive imprisonment. The proper objectives, we have been told repeatedly, are the protection of society from crime and the treatment of the offender, not the exaction of revenge and the criminal’s punishment. [The] words “retribution,” “revenge,” and “punishment” are often used interchangeably, as if there were no significant differences of meaning among them. The resulting confusion is the source of many problems. Retribution and revenge necessarily imply punishment, but it does not follow that punishment is eliminated under rehabilitative regimes.\nStruggle for Justice, p.20\n\nFor some decades before this, US prisons had officially embraced explicitly rehabilitative aims (although without always realising them). Imprisonment was often described as a form of ‘treatment’, which (in theory) would return the criminal to a ‘normal’, compliant relationship with the law. Punishment, in this account, was the exercise of coercive state power in the interests of the punished.\nThe authors argued that this simply masked a far uglier reality:\n\nIf […] in some circumstances we might employ coercion against an individual to achieve some compelling social goal, it […] obscures the moral nature of our act to pretend that we are not employing punishment […] There is an easy test that can be applied to any purported abolition of punishment or imprisonment. Is the proposed alternative program voluntary? Can the subject take it or leave it? If he takes it, can he leave it any time he wants? If the answer to any of these questions is “no”, then the wolf is still under the sheepskin.\nStruggle for Justice, p.23\n\nThey took this argument further: even if punishment was guaranteed to benefit the subject, this should play no part in deciding whether to impose it. They offered three reasons for this view:\n\n[T]he paternalism implicit in A’s assumption that he knows better than B what is for B’s benefit is treacherous under any circumstances and becomes an intolerable form of colonialism when invoked by middle-class whites to run the lives of blacks, Chicanos, Indians, and the poor. [T]he natural progress of any program of coercion is one of escalation [so that] the more it is relied upon, the easier it will be to employ it as an evasion of difficult problems and the larger the dosage that will have to be applied […] [And] the availability of coercive solutions to a problem reduces the likelihood of trying more creative but more difficult […] voluntary alternatives […] we think it imperative to regard punishment not as a potential benefit to the subject but invariably as a detriment imposed out of social necessity.\nStruggle for Justice, p.25"

    "text": "When is rehabilitation illegitimate?\nThe first of these three reasons is a principled objection based on what the authors see as the proper relationship between the state and its citizens. The second and third are practical warnings about the dangers of over-reliance on coercion; the third in particular suggests that individuals possess the right to exercise choice over the conditions of their own lives.\nTaken together, these are not far distant from the idea, highly influential in today’s progressive/identity politics, that people’s lived experience is authoritative when it comes to the conditions of their own lives. Others might hold them responsible for their actions, but can’t seek negate their experiences or compel them to change their values.\nThis insight runs through the report itself. For the authors of Struggle for Justice, punishment used coercively to impose ‘help’ on people that they would not otherwise have chosen immediately runs into moral difficulties, and efforts at penal ‘reform’ do not excuse the coercive nature of the institution:\n\nAs experienced by the prisoner, imprisonment with treatment is identical with traditional imprisonment in most significant aspects […] The reformist’s range of vision excludes the reality of the view point of the offender […] to the reformist, the only relevant criterion is the purity of the motives of society and its judges and jailers […] We submit that the basic evils of imprisonment are that it denies autonomy, degrades dignity, impairs or destroys self-reliance, inculcates authoritarian values, minimizes the likelihood of beneficial interaction with one’s peers, fractures family ties, destroys the family’s economic stability, and prejudices the prisoner’s future prospects for any improvement in his economic and social status. It does all these things whether or not the buildings are antiseptic or dirty, the aroma that of fresh bread or stale urine, the sleeping accommodation a plank or an innerspring mattress, or the interaction of inmates takes place in cells and corridors […] or in the structured setting of [group therapy].\nStruggle for Justice, pp.25 and 33, italics added\n\nFor this reason, they argued, punishment should only be thought of as a harmful last resort, and never as of potential benefit to the convicted person.\nOn first glance, this is quite a challenging conclusion to reformers: ruling out any form of positive outcome risks being used in support of ever-harsher versions of punishment. However, the report does not argue for the withdrawal of support from those caught up in the criminal justice system, but rather the separation of support from coercion.\nIn the next post, I’ll develop that point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImage in the public domain, via Wikimedia Commons."

    "section": "How relevant is Struggle for Justice today?",
    "text": "How relevant is Struggle for Justice today?\nIn England and Wales today, our criminal justice system (measured purely on the basis of imprisonment rates and sentence length) is among the most punitive in Europe, though still much less punitive than the contemporary USA. There are an unusually high number of lifers serving severe and indefinite sentences. In spite of this, attempts at rehabilitation are not dead. There is a substantial literature on ‘what works’ in rehabilitation, standing on a firmer evidential base than in the past. Risk assessment is more systematic and transparent than when it was principally a matter of official discretion, and discretion itself has been checked by the publication of more transparent policies, and by more clearly stated rights for prisoners. These developments kick away some aspects of the case against rehabilitation that the authors of Struggle for Justice put forward.\nOn the other hand, Struggle for Justice’s core argument (i.e. rehabilitative power can become unaccountable, and increase the severity of punishment) is not entirely irrelevant today. Knowledge of ‘what works’ remains imperfect, and what knowledge there is doesn’t always agree about who is doing the ‘work’ in rehabilitation. Risk assessment and sentence planning can lack transparency for those being punished (who are most affected), with the result that some find it difficult to navigate what is required of them and are punished for longer as a result. Rehabilitative provision has been damaged by austerity, and is directed towards those held to pose the greatest ‘risk’ to others, arguably at the cost of those whose needs are complex but who pose a risk mainly to themselves. Power differentials, particularly in prisons, remain steep. Rehabilitation, in short, can still be framed in a relatively narrow, top-down way, and the help it offers can be diluted by other objectives.\nSo while times have changed, I think historical texts such as the AFSC report can be instructive: they show how seemingly familiar issues once had very unfamiliar features, and force us to think about change alongside continuity in this way. What we take for granted is shown to be contingent, and we are jolted out of our assumptions. This can help us to notice aspects of contemporary reality which we might otherwise miss."

    "text": "Are lifers ‘rehabilitated’ by lengthy imprisonment?\nRecent research has demonstrated that many long-term prisoners manage to glean something positive and valuable from the sentence, despite finding the experience immensely painful and troubling, particularly at the start. They are very unlikely, compared to other released prisoners, to commit further offences in future. If this outcome is our measure of success, then it’s tempting to conclude that long-term imprisonment is ‘working’: the ends justify the means, and prisoners are ‘being rehabilitated’.\nStruggle for Justice suggests that this conclusion might be a mistake. It does so by highlighting that ‘punitive’ and ‘rehabilitative’ are not opposites. Creditable intentions do not automatically excuse discreditable outcomes. Rehabilitative punishment is still punishment: still coercive, still damaging, still capable of producing side effects.\nA more useful distinction to make is between ‘rehabilitation’ and ‘retribution’. This draws attention not to whether coercive power is in itself the problem, but to what it is being used for. If it aims at ‘retribution’, it seeks simply to exact a price for past wrongdoing. As the Quaker writer John Lampen suggests, we might think of revenge as an ugly motive. But it is a simpler goal to define and evaluate than that of ‘changing’ someone.\nIt’s therefore also simpler to hold retributive power accountable. Rehabilitative power, by contrast, can more easily grow out of check. If the excesses of retribution are ugly but obvious, those of rehabilitation can be insidious and disguised: a dangerous road paved with good intentions."

    "section": "Does life imprisonment ‘work’?",
    "text": "Does life imprisonment ‘work’?\nSecond, we should be wary of justifying the use of coercive power to rehabilitate people simply on the basis that it seems to ‘work’. Most of us can imagine situations in which the ends don’t justify the means. For example, one way to make future offending less likely would be to physically mutilate, maim or kill the prisoner. Many people (and, I’d hazard a guess, all Quakers) would find such practices unacceptable, indicating that moral judgments play some part. If it was simply a question of ‘what works’, then such judgments would play no part.\nMore subtly, there are many ways in which prisoners might not just be ‘being rehabilitated’ — i.e. acted on by state power — but instead are ‘rehabilitating themselves’. Generally, limited resources are rationed, and ‘neo-paternalist’ forms of rehabilitation offered as a priority to prisoners who are classified as posing the highest risk. Such interventions (typically lasting months) typically form a tiny part of a life sentence (typically lasting decades). They can be resented by prisoners who experience them as condescending and manipulative, and engage guardedly or cynically, if at all. This was evident when one man I interviewed in 2017 suggested that the ‘voluntary’ language of rehabilitation programming failed to mask the coercion that underlay all aspects of his indeterminate sentence:\n\nThey say, “oh, we think you might benefit from doing PIPE.” Really, what they’re saying is, “we want you to do PIPE. You’ve got to do PIPE […] because you won’t be going to C-cat [i.e. a lower-security prison] otherwise” […] It’s just Catch-22. Basically, I’ve got to do it.\n‘Luke’ (not his real name)\n\nWhat really motivated him, he said, was getting out of prison so that he could provide for his family and be a ‘proper’ dad to his daughter. Currently it is hard to imagine the state intervening to prescribe parenthood or employment for prisoners, even if these are proven to be the most effective ‘treatments’ for their offending. Would fatherhood have given him the motivation to make a better life? If so, are rehabilitative interventions an honest attempt to seek his ‘benefit’, or are they (as he suggests) simply a sweetener for medicine he has to take anyway?"

I think this means we can’t properly evaluate long-term imprisonment without going inside prisons and taking quite a micro-level perspective on how power is being used, and how it feels to prisoners themselves to be subjected to it.\nThis means paying attention to their individual experiences, and not only aggregate measures such as reoffending rates. How does it feel to serve a long prison sentence? Is punishment more legitimate or painful to some people than others? How difficult is it to demonstrate ‘change’ in terms that are intelligible to the officials responsible for paroling them? Is it more difficult for some people than for others? Do some find it easier to benefit from rehabilitative programmes, education or work? I think these are questions worth asking."

    "title": "Three stories",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Today an interviewee told me three stories about different times he had briefly been outside prison, during a sentence that had lasted well over twenty years. Each of these was a little hiatus in his sentence, and he had clearly spent a considerable time reflecting on each one. He described them all as significant moments in how he had come to understand his life and his sentence; so here I just reproduce the stories, and what he said they meant.\nIn the first story, he was still a Category-A prisoner. He was taken for a medical appointment at a local hospital. He remembers being told very brusquely and very early in the morning that he had to be ready to leave in five minutes. He was strip-searched and then put in a special cat-A van. On arrival at the hospital he remembers being escorted by half a dozen prison officers in uniform. Dressed in an outfit that clearly marked him out as a prisoner, double-cuffed to a prison officer on both sides, he remembers being “marched” (his word) through the hospital corridors. On arrival, it was early in the morning and he remembers seeing only staff; after the appointment, the hospital was busy, and he remembers feeling as if he had a huge flashing light above his head: members of the public in the waiting area looked up as he passed through, distracted from thumbing their phone screens, they were suddenly transfixed by the sight of this shackled being in their midst, being hurried along by his minders. He felt incredibly prominent, and ashamed; and as they walked towards the van, he remembers a woman they passed saying to one of the officers, ‘God bless you for what you do.’ When he returned to the prison, he remembers feeling low for days. He had never really imagined that he would be released or that he deserved to be; and this experience intensified the fear of being shunned and singled out and stigmatised if he ever was. He remembers wondering whether he really wanted to make progress through the system, when it came to his forthcoming cat-A board.\nNot very long after this, he had to return to the same hospital for a second appointment. But at the board, he had been taken ‘off the book’ – in other words, after many years as a Category-A prisoner, he had been downgraded to B-cat, and was by now awaiting transfer to a medium-security prison. He remembers that this time, wing officers came to him and asked him, in a relaxed way, to go and put a jumper on. He said he didn’t feel rushed, and he wasn’t strip-searched. He was still cuffed, but only to one officer and with fewer escorts overall. He remembers travelling with them in a taxi, him dressed in ordinary clothes and them in uniform. He moved around the hospital without feeling that people were looking at him, though it was again busy. He said: “in prison it’s drummed into you again and again that you’re always being watched like a hawk”; but on this second visit he came back to the prison thrilling at the sight of livestock in fields on the journey home, and thrilling too that not everyone at the hospital had recognised him as a marked man.\nHe remembers this as a key moment during his sentence. Though he had already noticed some differences in his daily life since being recategorised – less regular cell searches, strip-searches, and so on – it was comparing the two hospital visits that he said really shifted his perspective. He realised how many of his perceptions – about himself, about his life, about how far he was from the real world, from normality, from the life that he hoped for – had all been shaped by his surroundings. In short, it suddenly dawned on him how institutionalised he had been. If the hospital could feel completely different on two visits because his escort arrangements had changed, then perhaps more in his self-understanding might also shift as his surroundings did. Perhaps there was more hope for the future, waiting for him somewhere else. He remembers feeling different about the impending move to another prison, and says he resolved to take this insight with him when he went there.\nThe third story he told was about being out on a work placement. By now, he was in an open prison, where I have been working lately and where I met him. He was sent, with other prisoners, on a supervised work party. They were helping to clear scrub and do gardening work on premises belonging to a community group nearby. On the way back to the prison in the afternoon, the minibus made a quick stop for a toilet break. He remembers walking back to the minibus through the car park of the shopping area where they had stopped. He was hyper-aware of the number of people all around, marvelling at their numbers and their busyness. Thinking about his hospital visits, he worried again about being prominent, about having that same warning lamp in the air above him. But he realised that though he was dressed in prison-issue clothing, all this meant was that he was wearing work trousers, a sweater and a hi-vis jacket. He realised that for everyone around him, he was just a face in the crowd: not immediately visible as a prisoner; not labelled ‘murderer’; not different; not judged.\nHe said that this realisation was followed, on the drive back, by a wave of emotion which he found it very hard to connect with or make sense of. This troubled him, and he continued to think about it for some days after he got back to the prison. What was this feeling and what did it mean?\nI asked him the same question. He referred back to his descriptions, earlier in the interview, of his time in therapy, while still in the high-security prison. One of the hardest things he had had to do, he said, was come to terms with the idea that he was the person who committed the offences he had been convicted of. Instead of dissociating, and retreating into fantasies and victimhood (as he said he had done before) he had had to find ways of saying that he was responsible for having taken life. With this went a deep and alienating fear of himself: if it had happened, then it could happen again. And along with that, he said, had gone an understanding of himself as always potentially ‘dangerous’. He said he did not object to this idea; it was fair enough for others to think of him that way, he said, and he understood why ‘the system’ thought that way. But… “you also have to find ways of moving on”, he said; to recognise yourself as a changed person; an individual who can make decisions and choices different from those you made before. The idea that you were ‘dangerous’ or ‘risky’ meant a permanent awareness of possibly being judged, being ‘tarred with the same brush’ (his words again, but a phrase that has come up again and again in interviews).\nIn therapy, he said, this internalisation of ‘dangerousness’ led to a great deal of introspection: thinking and rethinking in obsessive detail the minutiae of everyday interactions. Every emotion and reaction was held up and reflected upon. What he had experienced in the car park was no different: he was not surprised by the strength of the reaction, since it was one of the first times he had been in a public place without handcuffs on for more than half a lifetime. But still: what did the reaction mean? Why was he so moved by the feeling of anonymity? Would unpacking this experience reveal it to be a problem? Should he worry about it, or disclose it?\nEventually, he said he had discussed it with a member of staff in the prison. He had had to ask several times and then to put in an application to have this conversation with the person he wanted to see. Officers on his unit thought he was worrying over nothing, but he had insisted, saying that he had learned this lesson in therapy: when things are troubling you, you talk about them. The officers did not understand: all they knew was the place they worked, he said, and they had no idea of the journey he had been on over two decades and more.\nWhen he sat down for the conversation he wanted, he explained what had happened. What was this feeling he had struggled to connect with or understand?\nMaybe, she said, it was happiness. Or relief. Maybe those weren’t something to worry about.\nHe remembers realising that she was right. He compared this realisation to the one he had had after the second hospital visit. In constantly obsessing over his every thought and every reaction, he had once again been shaped by his environment, and institutionalised. He had grown accustomed to making a problem out of himself. Everything had to be unpacked and examined, everything had to be assessed. It had not occurred to him that happiness, or relief, might not be problems: they might just be happiness, or relief. He described this as another moment of hope; and in general, his descriptions of life in the open prison have been unusually reflective (and unusually positive) compared to many of his peers.\nI wondered if the experience in the car park might have signalled something to him: a glimpse of a life beyond punishment, of a time when he no longer has to constantly practice self-vigilance. Of course, he knows that his life licence means that he will always have to make those disclosures and have those conversations sometimes, with some people. But he said this third out-of-prison experience had disclosed that in some moments, he would be invisible and unremarkable. He said that on subsequent day releases, he has savoured these moments: he could use them to begin to experience what he said he had wanted to be for a very long time: normal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have been unable to locate the copyright information for this image.

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nPeople who have gone through Grendon often stand out when you meet them. While drafting the lecture my research fieldwork took me to an open prison, where a colleague and I interviewed a focus group composed of four men. Within a minute or two of the interview starting, the way one man was talking made me think, “Grendon”. And sure enough, later in the interview he mentioned that he had done part of his sentence there.↩︎\nTime is short, so if you’re interested, the pre-recorded interview with me released by Woodbrooke says more than I can say tonight, and the written version of the lecture will too.↩︎\nUnusually for someone in his position, he had a sentence in which the release date was fixed. He had originally been given an indeterminate sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), but this was overturned on appeal and substituted instead for a determinate sentence. As a result, Khan’s release was not decided via risk-assessment, but was automatic. He was also released directly from a maximum-security prison. This is extremely unusual, and meant that he had not made the usual series of stepped progressive moves into medium and then lower-security prisons. Were he to have undergone a more ‘normal’ release process, measures which aim to restore some freedoms in structured and monitored ways, and monitor compliance, would have kicked in. Policymakers and practitioners who gave evidence to the inquests, or who offered media punditry on the issues raised, seized on his automatic release as a major problem, since it was not decided via risk assessment. Parliament soon legislated to ensure that anyone with a terrorist conviction (and several other groups) will serve more of the sentence in prison and be subject to far more stringent release and supervision arrangements, regardless of the sentence originally imposed. Thus, one effect of Khan’s actions was to directly disadvantage many people in similar situations to himself. This example underlines how public protection arrangements can become dysfunctional if they do not offer meaningful progression or pathways to release.↩︎\nA lengthy extract can be found in Quaker Faith & Practice, at 23.103.↩︎\nThis is a fiction, of course, but a useful one. None of us has ever actually said, as Lampen puts it, “I voluntarily surrender my right of retaliation to the state”. But consider what can sometimes happen when people punish extrajudicially: when they act on perceived wrongs privately and informally, without states playing this limiting role. We might see cliquishness, passive-aggression, or social ostracisation; we might see the rolling, chaotic cruelties of social media pile-ons; we might see the actions of a violent spouse or an abusive parent; we might see lynchings; or we might see much of the tit-for-tat violence which puts people in prison. Even states do this sometimes, for example when they carry out targeted assassinations of their political enemies, using drones or other means. All of these situations are exercises of power without accountability, and many of the underlying conflicts could be handled using techniques such as restorative justice. But these are not always suitable where those involved do not consent to participate, and punishment is the fall-back. Lampen is reminding us that even if we don’t necessarily want to retaliate, it’s normal to feel powerful emotions if we are wronged—anger, blame, hatred, or disgust, for instance. It is also normal to want something to be done in response. But if everyone acts on these feelings, punishment has no end. “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”, Mahatma Gandhi is supposed to have said. Lampen is also reminding us, in theory, that if the state retaliates for us, then one of the useful things it’s doing is limiting retaliation, interrupting the relentless logic of revenge. This is a persuasive argument. But it’s also a reason we should be alarmed if it appears that the state has forgotten how to end punishments, or if its actions are disproportionate.↩︎\nV was formerly known as Eve Ensler.

    "text": "Adapting to and planning the sentence\n\nLifers generally spend the early years of the sentence in prisons in the long-term and high-security estate (LTHSE). The challenge during this period is to stabilise themselves, come to terms with the conviction and the sentence, and become accustomed to prison life.\nThey are also expected to be assessed for (and to begin to undertake) offence-related work. To do this, they have to work with prison staff to produce a sentence plan setting objectives that map out a template for progression for the rest of the sentence.\nThe challenges of adaptation and the strategies that life-sentenced prisoners use to meet them have been comprehensively described by a recent study of prisoners given life sentences when aged 25 or less.23 There is no need to repeat that analysis, except to reiterate that ‘adapting’ involves:\n\nlearning to ‘let go’ of feelings and attachments relating to life before prison\naccepting that prison is now where life has to be lived\nfinding outlets for the feelings of anger and despair that this process entails\nseeking ways in which the experiences of the sentence can be reframed as some kind of preparation for the future\n\nI do, however, make two additional observations about ‘adaptation’ among lifers in my PhD sample:\n\n‘Adapting’ in the early stages of the sentence a very different challenge for those convicted in middle age or in later life. These men would be released past retirement age, and their thoughts about the future differed. Many had had careers and families before prison, so prison was not blocking them from achieving these goals. Though some regretted their loss of social status, the sentence had freed them of responsibilities, and afforded them time to pursue opportunities (such as exploring artistic talent or practising meditation) that had never been priorities before. Matt (quoted above) was convicted in his fifties and was less than two years into a thirty-year tariff. He said he was thinking of the sentence as ‘early retirement’.\nSome participants described their sentences as featuring more than one period of adaptation. In particular, bereavements outside prison were consistently reported as calling other priorities into question, prompting prolonged feelings of dislocation and distress, which were not easily resolved.\n\nThe challenges of this stage of the sentence mostly related to finding it difficult to understand how to progress, but they also related to difficulties relinquishing the relationships and the social status that the prisoner had enjoyed before their conviction.\n\nSome were confused about how the sentence worked, and even such basic matters as what the tariff meant. One man at Swaleside appeared to believe, two years into his sentence, that the tariff meant he would definitely be released after a fixed number of years. Basic misunderstandings about how the sentence works among lifers at these early stages are obviously a serious concern. Others said they had had limited communications with staff responsible for their sentence planning, and/or that they had no idea what was on their sentence plan. The impression this gave was those who were not driving forward with their own plans would not be pushed to develop any. Both factors suggest a wider confusion, expressed particularly by those who were younger and angrier about the conviction, about what was expected of them and how they might progress.\nA second group who had found adapting and progressing in the early years of the sentence were those for whom the sentence had created particularly large disruptions to family contact. They had had close family relationships before imprisonment, but were usually either foreign nationals, or had risk assessments that placed conditions and blocks on family contact which they found hard to accept. These difficulties showed either as distress and hopelessness, or as anger and complaint, with one man (Janusz, quoted on this page) having represented himself in the family courts. Family contact had become a major sticking point in their relationship with the sentence, standing in the way of adaptation and accepting their position.\nA third group who struggled with adapting to prison in the initial stages of the sentence—who were not ‘getting on with it’—were those who had enjoyed relatively high social status before prison, and who found it hard to accept their loss of status, as well as often finding the environment itself frightening and unsafe. Among this subgroup expressions of distaste or even disdain for other prisoners whom they described using words such as ‘rowdy’ or ‘criminal’ were common, as was the perception that rehabilitative provision was aimed at these men, not at them. Further, they often measured their own moral worth not with reference to the offence or the conviction, but with reference to norms of interpersonal behaviour, pointing to these as evidence that they were not in need of reformative work, or that what was on offer was not capable of rehabilitating them or meeting their needs."

    "section": "Core risk reduction",
    "text": "Core risk reduction\n\nBeginning in the LTHSE and continuing sometimes long afterwards, lifers are expected to undertake offence-related work aiming to ‘reduce their risk’. The nature of this core offence-focused work varies widely; for some it may be completed in the first few years of the sentence, while for others it might not even begin until much later.\nCore risk reduction work varies significantly in scope and intensity. ‘Offending behaviour programmes’ or more colloquially, ‘courses’ are prominent. Participation in courses is not mandatory, but most lifers understand their centrality to the prison’s rehabilitative ‘offer’, and that it will be difficult for them to progress or pass the Parole Board’s release test without completing courses; most therefore see them as mandatory even though this is not strictly so. A given individual might do both cognitive-behavioural courses and therapeutic groupwork at different sentence stages, depending on the aims of the course, the content of the individual’s sentence plan and risk and needs assessments, and the content of reports about how they have performed in other contexts already. Behaviour in custody (for example a record of violence) can lead additional risks and needs to be identified, so that it is possible for new risk-reducing work to arise which is not connected with the original offence.24\nCourses typically involve classroom-based groupwork based on cognitive-behavioural techniques, but forms of longer-term therapy (typically in groups, but much less commonly one-to-one) also exist and count as risk-reducing work.\n\nCognitive-behavioural courses vary substantially in aims, content, length and intensity: from low-intensity courses, targeted at those prisoners assessed as posing a lower risk of future harm and usually delivered with a session or two a week over a number of weeks; to high-intensity courses offered to those believed to pose a higher risk of harm, and delivered three or more days a week over many months. The main subdivisions are among courses addressing general violence, domestic violence, and sexual offending.\nTherapeutic interventions last longer, are somewhat more open-ended, and involve a more holistic approach. They also address the offence, but treat it as part of a longer and more holistic story, for example enabling those with histories of significant childhood adversity and complex trauma to explore how their pasts may have contributed to their development as a person and to their eventual offending and conviction, or seeking to induce those who have been violent or have struggled to adapt in prison to reflect on the reasons for their lack of integration.\n\nRegardless of intensity and length, most cognitive-behavioural programmes share the aim of helping the prisoner explore the attitudes and thinking that led to his offending behaviour, and to teach him ‘skills’ by which he might better understand and manage his emotions in future, and thereby also ‘manage his risk’. The implication throughout is that the prisoner, once convicted, remains in some sense ‘risky’ for life, otherwise ‘skills’ would not be required.\nWhere a lifer’s risk is relatively low to begin with, sentence plans typically set relatively few objectives for ‘offence-focused work’. One consequence is that those assessed as low-risk often encounter relatively little intervention, and that this is predicated on future risk and not past actions. Some lifers (like Terry, quoted on this page) find this perplexing, because what makes them eligible for courses is not clear to them. They link eligibility to being willing to take responsibility for the offence, whereas eligibility appears instead to be linked to being willing to work with prison staff to discuss how the probability of future offending might be reduced.\nWhere risk is relatively high to begin with, sentence plans are often more detailed and more complex, involving longer lists of more intensive interventions, and also often targets which aim to support (and surveil) lifers’ use of risk-managing ‘skills’ in relatively more controlled and supervised prison settings, such as Psychologically Informed Planned Environments (PIPEs). Core risk reduction work should therefore be understood as being concentrated in the earlier parts of the sentence, but with consequences that extend throughout the sentence and indeed after release, because of how risk assessments, behavioural expectations and licence conditions are formulated.\nCore risk reduction work is offered in LTHSE prisons, but also in prisons with specialist roles, particularly where the offence featured a sexual motive, or where the individual in question has specific needs (e.g. a learning disability or a personality disorder).\nCore risk reduction work challenged different people in the sample in different ways. Those who were deeply ashamed of the offence (and hence, on some level, agreed that they deserved punishment) usually tackled sentence plan requirements willingly, though most confronted deep distress as a consequence. Those who admitted responsibility but felt less ashamed (often having committed murder in the context of wider criminality), seemed less troubled by the offence itself, but generally were willing to engage in risk-reducing work as a way of working towards release and a better future. They were often less troubled by grappling with the ‘deep’ psychological roots of their violence and were drawn to the language of learning ‘skills’ to improve their lives in future.25\nThe group of participants who found core risk reduction work the most challenging were, uniformly, those who did not fully accept they were as culpable as the conviction declared them to have been. For these men risk reduction work entailed significant cognitive effort and worry, because they believed that what they said about the offence and what the official record declared about the offence would be compared, with discrepancies potentially having consequences for risk scores, sentence plans, security categorisations, and so on, as well as highlighting the potential that they were being dishonest. Some found themselves unable or unwilling to reach a public position which would enable them to get what they could from risk-reducing work (see paragraph 69.d below). I am unable to form an opinion about the justifiability or otherwise of these claims not to have been culpable, but it was clear that, however well-founded, they had felt like a barrier to making progress with the sentence.\nThose who could not accept the degree of culpability implied by the conviction were in a broad and varied category, not simply confined to those who said they were completely innocent, but encompassing a wide and nuanced range of public stances in relation to the offence, including the following:\n\nMen who said they had had no involvement at all in the events leading up to their index offence (or maintained that the index offence had not occurred at all, for example because the court had accepted an incorrect account of how the victim’s death was caused);\nMen who admitted involvement in events leading to the index offence, but said their involvement was peripheral, that others (who may or may not have been prosecuted alongside them) had been involved, and that those others were equally or more culpable;\nMen who admitted sole responsibility for the harms involved in the offence, but questioned the degree of culpability this implied;26\nMen who remained silent and therefore took no public stance about the offence, for example by declining to participate in sentence planning meetings or to participate in courses.\n\nRisk reduction strongly incentivises self-disclosure. It also, however, transfers the risks of self-disclosure onto the individual, often with the consequence that if they decline to cooperate, they might appear ‘risky’, since it appears to mean they are ‘not taking responsibility’ for the offence. Those with particular offences or histories can be exposed to a higher risk of violence, or may simply have life experiences that cause them to be cautious in trusting others. Some participants explicitly linked selectiveness in self-disclosure—about their offence and about their lives generally—to their safety. For Billy, for example, self-disclosure in a small group setting risked unacceptable consequences in his day-to-day life. He said at the time he had left therapy, the reasons for his non-cooperation had not been clear to the prison authorities, so that it was not until years later that an alternative to group therapy was recommended for him. In the meantime, he had not done any risk-reducing work. This connection between ‘denial’ and safety in prison means that we should be sceptical of a straightforward link between denial and risk.\nIndeed, a straightforward connection between ‘denial’ (or other forms of minimising blame) and ‘risk’ is poorly supported by empirical evidence. The connection between the two appears in fact to be far more complex, sometimes pointing in the opposite direction, and suggesting that individuals may have a wide range of reasons for ‘denial’, often connected not with their attitudes to the past, but instead to their future relationships with others (and their relationship with themselves). ‘Denial’ may just as well be a way to manage shame and ostracism among people who privately might accept guilt, but feel unable for whatever reason to make this a public stance.27\nAlthough lifers in my research have said that disputing their blameworthiness has made smooth progress through their sentences more difficult, a recent change in how HMPPS psychology and programmes staff approach denial may have somewhat altered this picture in ways that would not be clear through the interviews, meaning that a brief qualification is required for what goes above. Since the mid-2010s, the approach to denial in HMPPS offending behaviour programmes has shifted subtly, away from a strict focus on accountability for the past harms of the index offence, and towards an approach emphasising the reduction and management of future risk. This means that an individual who disputes their responsibility for and/or culpability in the index offence, but who is willing to discuss other similar offending (or other non-offending behaviour relevant to the ‘criminogenic needs’ suggested by the offence), may still progress satisfactorily through an offending behaviour course. Conversely, if they deny the index offence (or are unwilling to discuss it in a course) but are also unwilling or unable to identify a relevant pattern of behaviour which they can then discuss in a course, it can still be difficult for them to perform satisfactorily against the expectation that they must learn ‘skills’ that manage or reduce risk.\nThe recency of this shift in provision (combined with the fact that most participants had done their offending behaviour work before it occurred) makes it difficult to gauge the impact of this shift in emphasis.28 But several men in the sample, who had either maintained a nuanced position regarding the offence, or disputed their relative culpability in relation to co-defendants, did explicitly say that their ‘denial’ had delayed their progress, for example because differences between their account and the official account of the offence had become a point of conflict with staff, causing them to be written off as untrustworthy, argumentative, or ‘deniers’. Some felt marginalised and alienated by this, because they felt an incomplete admission of guilt had been used to prolong their punishment.29"

    "text": "Passing time, using time, or ‘treading water’\n\nAt a point usually coming after some or all the core risk reduction work is complete, and usually after at least a third of the tariff has been completed, lifers transfer from their ‘original’ prison, either to another prison within the LTHSE, or to a prison offering specialist rehabilitative provision, or to a prison with a lower security category (reflecting a reduced security categorisation and altered levels of risk). Given the length of minimum terms, recategorisations and transfers can be multiple and this phase last for more than a decade.30\nAlthough the sentence plan continues to be reviewed regularly, sentence plan objectives set at this time tend to frame these periods as a time of ‘developing skills’—during which, in theory, the individual is being monitored for their ability to use the risk management ‘skills’ that they have learned while doing offending behaviour work. This appears meaningful for some, particularly those who have undergone profound personal changes as a consequence of intensive risk-reducing interventions. But many lifers in this stage of the sentence whose core risk reduction targets have been met struggle to recall the objectives on the sentence plan, or speak of them in terms other than ‘developing my skills’; they understand this stage of the sentence as a question of consuming years while also ‘staying out of trouble’.\nFor many, there was what might be called a fallow period in the sentence, during which years and sometimes more than a decade passed without the individual in question feeling like they were making progress. This was especially common among those with tariffs exceeding 20 years, for whom there were simply more years to get through.31 For many, this period came in the middle stretches of the sentence, after they had adjusted to prison life and completed the offending behaviour work on their sentence plan, but before they were close enough to their tariff date to be considered for a move to an open prison. For a few, long fallow periods occurred nearer the start of the sentence, especially if they were appealing the conviction or the sentence (and were therefore unwilling to undertake offending behaviour work).\nA very small number of men in the sample said they had decided on long-term objectives for the middle years of the sentence, and they had pursued these determinedly. These men saw stagnation as a risk to their wellbeing and had made significant achievements such as completing Open University degrees or had become involved in projects seeking to improve the quality of the prison community (for example by working as Samaritans-trained prison Listeners, or by working in other highly responsible roles). These activities were often described explicitly as ways to ‘do good’ or to ‘use time’ well. Such purposefulness brought its own risks, particularly if resources required to pursue these ambitions were contingent on residing in a particular prison, holding particular jobs, or having good relationships with particular members of staff. Any of these meant that things they valued could also easily be lost to security restrictions or changes of policy and the like, unless the individual concerned was prepared to fight. This in turn brought risks in terms of conflict with key prison staff, and required careful balancing on behalf of the lifer in question.\nHowever, strategising of this kind, whereby lifers planned ahead and formulated goals of their own for the rest of the sentence, was uncommon. More individuals in the sample saw progression towards release as a mysterious and essentially unknowable process, tracking not their priorities for their own lives, but HMPPS’s priorities for them. They cultivated either limited ambitions, or an ethic of passivity and an attitude of non-attachment, which rather than exerting great effort towards ambitions of self-betterment, sought friendship, ease and enjoyment as common themes. Many in this group sought out niches of greater material comfort (a single cell and self-cook facilities were often specific wishes). Some also preferred to be in a particular prison because it was closer to family. Some in Swaleside said they were trying to delay their recategorisation, so that they could remain for longer in the LTHSE (which afforded them more of these comforts). The phrase ‘limbo’ was used by Leon (quoted on this page), but ‘treading water’ was more common. It was used both by prisoners and by an officer at Swaleside, and well captures the challenges of the middle reaches of the sentence: keeping one’s head above water, not wasting energy pursuing objectives one might be disappointed not to achieve, and waiting for the tide to pull back towards the shore.\nIn terms of reform and rehabilitative aims, prisoners in this stage of the sentence said they felt slightly left to their own devices, without necessarily having a clear sense of what their priorities should be or what their time was to be used for. This was less true of those who still had core risk-reduction work to complete, because sentence plan targets tended to be more specific (and more intelligible to the prisoner) when they related to courses, and less specific or non-existent if it came to coaching life-sentenced prisoners to develop themselves after their core risk reduction work was done. The effect is that prisoners in this stage of the sentence generally only describe having a strong sense of purpose and of using time (rather than passing or killing it) if they have either found their own goals to pursue, or are being steered towards further risk reduction work. Many were content to work in whatever prison jobs were available and to enjoy what they could about the prison environment. Frustration was less likely among this subgroup, though the usage of terms such as ‘groundhog day’ to describe the texture of their daily lives hinted at the feeling that time was passing without any real sense of personally meaningful progress.\nLifers who have completed their core risk reduction work have, in many cases, done what the prison expects them to do, in terms of coming to terms with the past and with their offence, and thinking ahead to the future. In this stage of the sentence, their focus appears to turn to preparing for the future. However, life sentences are now very long indeed, with rehabilitative provision that seems more built to ‘fix’ them than to encourage them to push on. The post-release future can still be as much as a decade or more distant when core risk reduction work is complete. For many (and in my opinion eventually for most) the idea that the period after core risk reduction work is for ‘developing skills’ loses its meaning. So many lifers reach this point long before their tariff date, and the limited opportunities on offer mean that it is difficult to experience this period of their lives as ‘progressive’ in the same way that risk reduction work is for many. If prison is still frustrating or obstructing the realisation of their future plans, then ‘developing skills’ is a way to ward off the worry that life is being wasted. The essence of this stage of the sentence is working out how to use, pass, or waste time."

    "text": "The parole cycle, and preparing for release\n\nUsually around three years before the tariff expires, lifers first encounter the parole process, whereby assessments begin to decide whether they are suitable for transfer to an open prison. Because this decision is taken by a panel of independent Parole Board members, and premised fundamentally on risk assessment, each parole window entails the preparation of a dossier of evidence often hundreds of pages in length. It therefore also involves fresh eyes on the individual’s prison record.\nThe difficulties associated with the parole process are associated with hope and impatience (on the one hand), and with the intensifying of the prison’s gaze and focus on the individual (on the other). The preparation of written reports32 by forensic psychologists and others, including sometimes a lifer’s legal representative, can be a stressful process and contain some surprises, particularly for those whose custodial record has been patchy, whose offence was shocking, or who are seen potentially risky after release (this will include most mandatory lifers). Elevated levels of scrutiny, more so than in recent years of the sentence, can result in new sentence plan requirements, usually aiming at further recommendations for core risk reduction work. These in turn can mean more years in prison. Conversely, a recommendation for a move to open conditions, or even for release, can bring significant worry and uncertainty. Many lifers in the sample therefore described this period as characterised by significant anxiety. Some said that it also made them feel more accountable to loved ones outside prison, with a ‘knockback’ decision often causing them to have to explain to family members why they had not progressed, when they were often unsure as to the reasons, because the decision had come as a surprise. The parole process also brought home feelings of powerlessness regarding the outcome of decisions.\nMany of the difficulties of this period in the sentence concerned release and the uncertainty of the parole process, and were particularly centred on key relationships, particularly that with the offender manager. Good relationships with these staff members often offered greater confidence at seeing what might be around the corner, but the relationship seemed, like many between prisoners and staff, when each side understood the pressures the other was under and knew how to ask for things persistently without becoming confrontational. Staff shortages and changes of personnel in the offender management units at both research prisons were a subject of frequent complaint, because a new offender manager (or offender supervisor) could mean greater uncertainty and potentially a new relationship to relearn. All of these are ordinary features about human social interaction but the power imbalance and the amount that was at stake in decision-making meant that some described life while in a parole window using metaphors like ‘thin ice’ and ‘walking on eggshells’, suggesting the delicacy of their position.\nLifers in the sample who had gone over tariff33 were, of course, all ‘in the parole process’, though some appeared to be closer to the ‘exit’ than others. Generally and unsurprisingly, those who had been through the process more times without being released were less favourably disposed towards it, and some found the cycle of hope and disappointment hard to endure. Those who were only one or two hearings past the tariff generally said they were happy to wait and were in no hurry. They mostly identified closely with the notion that they were ‘risky’ and agreed that their risks required testing through home leaves and ROTLs. However, those who were further past the tariff more frequently expressed sentiments of indifference, frustration or cynicism about their situation, and also struggled to see how further interventions would improve their situation."

In my research sample, there were, for example, men who had not got out of the maximum-security prisons until after their tariff had expired; and there were others who moved from category-B to category-C (and awaited a first transfer away from the LTHSE) only two years into the sentence.↩︎\nWilliam, quoted next to this paragraph, had over 20 years left to serve, and disclosed that he had become addicted to heroin while in the prison where he was interviewed.↩︎\nFor many lifers this will be the first such report, but for some, especially those who have been in Category-A or who have been previously categorised as high-risk, psychological reports will be more familiar.↩︎\nFifteen lifers interviewed for the PhD were between one and twenty-two years over tariff at the time of the interview.↩︎"

That’s the way I look at things […] Going from B to C to D, no– I don’t think that’s progress. I just think that’s just the natural course of events.\nGrant\n\n\nBJ: Your tariff was… what, ten years ago, eleven years ago now?\nJeff: Eleven. I knew I’d go past, but I didn’t know I’d go past it this long […] I just kept thinking to myself, “how long have I got to do? How long am I going to be here for?” And then it was a year, another year, another year [and] I started thinking, “Pfffft… Part of the furniture now, innit?”3\n\nGrant and Jeff were both held in an open prison. Both aged around sixty and both convicted of murder many years before, Grant, who was nearing his ‘tariff’ date,4 had recently learned that prison staff were recommending that the Parole Board release him, reasoning that the risk of his harming others again was manageable. Jeff’s tariff, however, had long since passed, and his record of occasionally unpredictable behaviour in custody left the impression of a riskier release. Although Jeff felt like ‘part of the furniture’—a forgotten and unnoticed feature of a wider scene—official worries associated with his possible release meant he was in fact subject to more intense behaviour monitoring than many of his peers, though whether he was aware of this was less clear. He was eager for release but uncertain what could bring it about, while Grant, who was likely to be released soon, said he was ‘in no hurry’.\nAs Grant’s words suggest, both men had progressed well enough against official expectations that they were trusted in an open prison. Even so, both also shared the feeling that their ethical lives were thwarted by the sentence, in that their efforts to ‘do the right thing’ over many years had still left them unable to realise the long-term intentions which really mattered to them. \nTo explain this situation, it is first necessary to review recent anthropological scholarship for an account of how people strive to shape themselves into whom they need to become. Two theoretical strands in this literature are discussed, before the specifics of each empirical case are described in greater detail. A final, concluding section discusses how Jeff’s and Grant’s attempts to be ethical were frustrated by the way officialdom addressed them about ethics: by imposing quasi-universal moral obligations, which were difficult if not impossible for them to realise in practice."

Historic\n    allegations of abuse by staff in custodial institutions which held\n    children are now being heard by the courts and by the Independent\n    Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), and some criminal trials\n    have resulted in convictions. A persistent question prompted by\n    these investigations is that of why the victims of custodial child\n    abuse were for so long denied recognition as such, or any form of\n    redress. Drawing on original documentary research, this article aims\n    to explain why and how state authorities in England and Wales failed\n    to recognise the victimisation of children held in penal\n    institutions between 1960 and 1990, and argues that this failure\n    constitutes a disavowal of the state’s responsibility. We show that\n    the victims of custodial child abuse were the victims of state\n    crimes by omission, because the state failed to recognise or to\n    uphold a duty of care. We argue further that this was possible\n    because the occupational cultures and custodial practices of penal\n    institutions failed to recognise the structural and agentic\n    vulnerabilities of children. Adult staff were granted enormous\n    discretionary power which entitled them to act (and to define their\n    actions) without effective constraint. These findings, we suggest,\n    have implications for how custodial institutions for children should\n    think about the kinds of abuse which are manifest today.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJarman, B., & Lanskey, C.

There is a lot of room for things to be construed as abuse.\nBut the very idea that youth custody can even give rise to things called ‘child protection issues’ is a recent one. The statutory duty on residential institutions in general to have child protection policies only began with the 1989 Children Act. It didn’t apply to Prison Service establishments until 2002.\nThis is very recent. It means that before 2002, youth prisons combined a very risky environment with limited formal safeguards and no distinctive official discourse of child rights.\nAll the same, there were policies which aimed to respond to the risk that power could be misused. In general, though, these measures were weaker and less independent than today, and they regulate youth and adult prisons identically."

    "section": "A dilemma ",
    "text": "A dilemma \nA few years ago, a colleague of mine was in a difficult position. They had been engaged in a fraught back-and-forth with a funder, about the publication of data from a proposed project which would involve detailed ethnographic interviews with people in prison. Of central interest to the project was how participants felt about the reasons for their imprisonment. In many cases, would involve them narrating the circumstances surrounding a serious violent offence.\nThe funder, as is now standard, required the full anonymised dataset to be made available in a data repository. My colleague’s worry was that this requirement, imposed at the project’s inception, would entail the publication of highly personal and sensitive information about participants’ lives, something they might be ill-equipped to consent to. Some interviews would lead to quite deep and personal territory, and invite participants to describe deeply discrediting acts. All of this would put the researchers in a tricky position. Having secured participation on the basis that people’s stories would be handled and written up with respect, they would then publish an anonymised dataset online.\nMy colleague had been unsuccessful in trying to push back on the funder’s publication requirement, and felt that their principled objections were being ignored. They were seriously considering arguably oppositional responses./ Was it possible, for instance, in publishing the data, to specify access restrictions so stringent that the data would effectively be impossible to obtain? Or could such broad redactions be applied in de-identifying the interviews, that they would effectively become unusable by others?\nI’ve opened with this story because it exemplifies a broader tension between what we can broadly call an Open Research agenda, and the distinctive ethical and methodological commitments involved in qualitative research. My colleague’s position left me feeling conflicted. My instincts pull strongly towards openness, and towards the principles I associate with the Open Research agenda: in particular, the democratisation of knowledge, and the idea that there is a tight bond between the transparency, rigour, and credibility of knowledge.\nBut I could also understand my colleague’s position very well. Here was someone whose commitment to research ethics I knew to be sincere, and whose judgement I saw as exemplary, considering options which would never have seemed appropriate had they not been backed into a corner. It seemed that a broad top-down agenda for openness, imposed in some sense from outside, was the cause of this anxious, frustrated, defensive response. And it got me thinking about my own plans for the interviews from my own PhD.\nI had been intending to publish an anonymised version of my own interviews. Like I said, my instincts favour openness, and part of the reason I began the PhD was because of my past work for voluntary sector organisations in prisons. These are places in which there is a compelling public interest, and yet they are very difficult for any outsider to understand, particularly from the largely silenced perspective of prisoners themselves. Unlike my colleague, I had the luxury of a choice. I was funded by an ESRC studentship, but publication is only required for grant-funded studies.\nI ultimately decided against making my interview data openly available. I’ll describe a few of the reasons for that decision later, but I was aware at the time I would not have this choice in the future, and so I’ve tried to keep thinking about how openness interacts with the qualitative traditions. This talk will package up some of that thinking, and situate it in some subsequent debates."

    "section": "What is ‘openness’? ",
    "text": "What is ‘openness’? \nBefore delving into all of that, I want to very briefly clarify a few terms I’m going to use repeatedly today.\nBy Open Research, I mean what Michael Nielsen (n.d.) has called “the idea that scientific knowledge of all kinds should be openly shared as early as it is practical in the discovery process.” This is the broadest notion of openness, and from it flow some other ideas.\nSecond, we have Open Access, which most of us will by now be familiar with. Simply put, it reflects a specific commitment that publicly-funded research should be publicly available, not hidden behind paywalls. In some sense, the research belongs to the public, and should be available to the public.\nFinally, there’s Open Data, which extends this principle of openness to research data itself. This is my definition, but I want to highlight the idea that it involves a set of normative claims about the relationship between research data and research quality. It is associated with the idea that we should publish not just our findings, but the underlying data that supported them, making it available for reuse and verification. And it’s associated with various frameworks for thinking about data.\nI’ll come back to those frameworks later, but for now I want to note that these principles are not operationalised identically across different academic disciplines. In STEMM subjects and some quantitative social sciences, this normative agenda is particularly strongly articulated, for good reasons associated with reproducibility and the cost/benefit implications of secondary data reuse.\nThe social sciences more broadly have moved more slowly, and criminology especially so (Ashby 2020). There is some evidence of unease among qualitative researchers about Open Data (Bucerius & Copes 2024; e.g. Hanchard & San Roman Pineda 2023). As my colleague’s example illustrates, this isn’t a coincidence. Qualitative data give rise to particular ethical and practical questions.\nEven so, data publication is increasingly becoming a default practice, driven from above by funders. Currently, UKRI expects data arising from its funding “to be made as open as possible and as restricted as necessary”.1 There have been similar developments with publicly funded research in the United States (White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) 2022) and elsewhere.\nSo this is the wider context for my talk: something we might call an ‘Open Data agenda’, favouring data publication by default, and making the case in terms derived from the STEMM subjects and quantitative social sciences. How can we as qualitative researchers engage with this agenda?"

I claimed before that prisons are places of great public interest but very little public understanding.\nThis is because, sociologically, they are highly distinctive, in several important ways. First, they are closed institutions, deliberately separated from public view. Given the costs and contested moral status of imprisonment, we should want an informed debate about what happens in them. Yet access by researchers and other outsiders is difficult, and thus so is holding prisons accountable for what they do. Those of us who do gain access occupy a privileged position, and we should try and use it to promote understanding. When I said before that my instincts favoured openness, I meant this, more than I meant a claim about research quality.\nA further complication arises from the governance of access. On paper, research is highly regulated. You write careful ethics applications saying how you will handle data, and you go through a highly demanding gatekeeping process which rejects many research applications, on grounds which include security, but also prisoners’ vulnerability. As a result, there are clear boundaries around matters such as confidentiality.\nBut researchers have often noted that complex and contested organisational cultures influence prison life, to a far greater degree than the rules. Your relationships with prison officers and prisoners are crucial in conducting the research. Those relationships can be tricky, and sometimes ethically complicated. There are intense and murky subcultures among both staff and prisoners which impose demands that rules and policies do not always foresee. Consent is negotiated; trust is contingent and often temporary; motivations aren’t always clear; strong social undercurrents affect who talks to you and what they’re prepared to say.\nPrisoners, in particular, often have very different reasons for participating in research. Many are cynical about the potential for research to improve things, but some badly want their opinions to be heard; others hope there will be some intangible benefit to participation; some simply want to be let out of their cell for a couple of hours, or welcome the chance to talk with someone from the outside world. Prisoners engage with formal requirements like consent forms in varied ways, so that you sometimes have to really work to make the claim of informed consent a substantive, not a tenuous one.\nParadoxically, these complicated, hidden dynamics are often exactly what insiders—both prisoners and staff—say they wish the outside world knew more about.\nLet me illustrate this through a specific example. One of my participants, whom I’ll call Martin, was in prison for a murder committed in the grip of psychosis and involving extreme forms of violence. When I asked if Martin had a pseudonym he would prefer to be known by, he insisted he’d like to be known by his real name. He was proud of the changes he had made in prison, and the insights he had gained into the way he used and thought about violence. He was proud, too, that he could now walk away from the endless provocations of prison life, without ruminating on them endlessly or seeking vengeance. Martin wanted it known, including by those he’d harmed in the past, that he was no longer that person. But I couldn’t grant this request, because it’s a condition of access that no participant be identifiable, on the basis that this might cause further harm to their victims.\nI’d have liked to use Martin’s real name, since on a human level I think his record of desisting from extreme and habitual violence is something worthy of respect, acknowledgment, and perhaps celebration. But the wider rules of the research game mean I can’t do that. It’s a worthwhile illustration of my theme: who does Martin’s story belong to?\nMy key claim here is that three key tensions that run through all qualitative research, but prison research brings them into especially sharp relief.\nFirst, there is a tension between our transparency and credibility as researchers, and our duties to safeguard our participants and respect their confidentiality. This tension is particularly evident when those participants have inflicted serious harm on others, and when we require them to dwell in places of seclusion and separation.\nSecond, there is a tension between the formal governance structures we are subject to as researchers, and the underlying reality—especially evident in qualitative research—in which we carry out our investigations. This tension is pronounced when (as in prisons) social life is not entirely, or even mostly, governed formally.\nThe third tension is between voice and control. On one hand, we have the idea that one reason to use qualitative methods is to centre neglected perspectives, or (more vaguely) to in some sense give participants a ‘voice’, to respect their autonomous understanding of the world. On the other hand, we face the reality that sometimes the right to a ‘voice’ is contested, or controversial, and that sometimes, people may find the exposure that comes with having a voice uncomfortable, or regrettable.\nI’m claiming that anyone who uses qualitative methods has to think about these dynamics, but also that they are particularly evident in relation to the prison setting.\nI now want to step back from that setting, and examine how this kind of insight might cause us to think about managing research data."

    "section": "Theoretical frameworks and their limitations ",
    "text": "Theoretical frameworks and their limitations \n\nFAIR\nThe dominant framework, as many of us know, bears the acronym FAIR (Wilkinson et al. 2016). It posits that data should be prepared and published to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.2\nThese principles, while valuable, emerge from assumptions that don’t necessarily hold for the kind of research I’ve been talking about. One such assumption: the idea that data exists independently of research relationships, that it can be separated from context and reused without a loss of meaning, and that removing identifiers renders it safe to share.\nReturning to Martin’s case illustrates some of these problems. The details of Martin’s offence, and those of all but one of my other interviewees—can easily be found by searching online for contemporary media coverage of their court cases. It’s hard to eliminate the risk that a de-identified transcript of his interview might identify him to anyone with half an hour and the use of a search engine. Carelessness here could have have serious consequences. Some of Martin’s counterparts, for instance, were serving time for the murders of children, or offences against other vulnerable victims. Although it is rare, such people have been murdered by other prisoners. We cannot remove everything from which Martin’s identity could be deduced, without rendering the data less reusable and less accessible.\nMoreover, even were details of the index offence to be entirely redacted, Martin’s references to prison social life, in a setting where everyone knows everyone else’s business, could make him identifiable to insiders. More generally, participants might express attitudes about violence risk assessments or rehabilitative interventions, which might complicate their progression through the sentence, or otherwise delay their release from prison. What Martin might say to me, he might not choose to say to a parole board.\nOnce again, this exemplifies broader challenges with qualitative data sharing. I have dwelled mostly on risks associated with him becoming identifiable. But I could have mentioned others, including informed consent. Martin went to prison before the iPhone was invented; some of the men I interviewed had been in prison since I was a toddler, in the early 1980s. In this context, it’s really hard to see how I could adequately explain what it meant for anonymised data to be deposited in a research repository. How could I say these individuals had given their informed consent, even if they had signed a carefully worded consent form?\nSo the very details that make Martin’s story valuable for understanding the phenomena we’re studying, are the same details that make him identifiable, and it’s far from clear that these are data which can be interoperable, or reusable.\nSo what are we to do? One answer is to wish away the standardised governance, and simply refuse data publication. This is the choice I made with my PhD interviews, but I no longer have the same luxury. Another answer is to comply with data publication mandates, but to do so reluctantly or even with a certain covert resistance, depositing the data while also redacting it so thoroughly or restricting access so stringently that it becomes less useful. Another is to comply fully, and to side-line worries about protecting participants. We can pay lip service to open data, while at the same time rendering the data findable, inaccessible, un-interoperable, and hard to reuse.\nThese are imperfect choices. But that’s true of many choices in research. What I find helpful in such situations is knowing that other researchers with similar standpoints are also grappling with these issues, so that I can look to them for ideas. And that’s what I want to shift to now.\nI’m going to suggest two things: first, that we need different ways of thinking about what qualitative data is, and how we might approach questions of openness; and second, that we need to do that not from the standpoint of a single, top-down agenda for Open Research, but rather by engaging with that agenda from the distinctive positions we hold as researchers who use qualitative methods.\n\n\nDEAR\nIn 2021–22, I worked with an interdisciplinary working group at Cambridge, where I did my PhD, to develop an alternative framework for open research discourse. We were interested in how to respect qualitative researchers’ methodological integrity and ethical commitments, while also recognising the reality of funder requirements.\nIn the process of preparing our report (Westbury et al. 2022), a central challenge was methodological heterogeneity. There isn’t just one kind of qualitative data, and so approaches to openness need to vary by field. As I’ve tried to show, each research tradition might consider greater transparency in relation to distinctive concerns, worries, or advantages. In my case, the desire to see more informed debates about imprisonment is one such example.\nMembers of the working group were therefore not always in accord; but rather than trying to resolve these differences prescriptively, we asked whether a broader, better conceptualisation of qualitative data itself might be a starting point for more generative conversations about ‘openness’, within disciplines and research communities. The idea was to find a more productive terminology with respect to qualitative data than FAIR, and hopefully to facilitate discussion of the underlying issues in a way that did not feel quite so much like being dictated to.\nThe result was what we called the DEAR framework—standing for the idea that qualitative data is Dialogic, Emergent, Abundant, and Relational. Let me explain what we meant by each of these terms, returning to the prison setting to illustrate:\n\nDialogic: The data from my conversations with Martin and others didn’t simply exist, waiting to be collected. It emerged through dialogue, in a context of trust, which developed during a series of interpersonal conversations about what an interview would involve and why they might talk to me about their lives. A dialogic understanding of data has implications for matters like the accessibility and reusability of the data.\nEmergent: The findings from my PhD weren’t linear, standardised, or predictable in their relationship with the data. Each conversation led to subtly different insights and modified my understanding of life in the two prisons where I conducted the research. Had I spoken with different participants, or interviewed the same people in a different order, a different view might have emerged. This, again, has implications for ideas like ‘interoperability’ or ‘reusability’.\nAbundant: In total, I interviewed 66 men in three prisons about their lives, and made copious fieldnotes and notes from prison documents. Though a small N by some standards, this generated over a million words of interview transcripts, and many observational notes and notes from prison documents. Truly anonymising this body of data would involve a non-trivial quantity of labour, again with implications for what it takes to make it findable and accessible.\nRelational: Most importantly, the knowledge the PhD produces exists within, and depended upon, a web of relationships—among me, them, and a set of institutions. I can document and describe those relationships, but the meaning of the data are hard to separate, and there are implications for reuse.\n\nWho exactly ‘owns’ the data, and the knowledge that comes from it? My funder? Me? My university? My participants? The Prison Service? What I’m trying to say is that I think this isn’t a very good question. Instead of asking ‘whose data is it?’, we might ask, ‘what responsibilities arise from how this knowledge came into being?’ This shifts us from questions of ownership to questions of stewardship, from property to relationship - and this, I would suggest, offers us more productive ways to think about openness.\nI want to shift now to briefly describe a recent debate among American criminologists, which I think covers some of the same ground. I want to comment on how it arose, and how I think it exemplifies the kind of intradisciplinary conversation I’m calling for."

    "section": "A current debate ",
    "text": "A current debate \nIn January 2024, the US journal Criminology announced that all authors it published must, barring truly exceptional circumstances, deposit their data and code in a repository. This policy mirrored a change in federal research funding rules (White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) 2022), and was presented with reference to terms like “reproducibility” and “generalizability”. It would require qualitative researchers to upload interview transcripts, fieldnotes, and coding trees, with minimal restrictions.\nTwo members of the journal’s editorial advisory board, both qualitative researchers, published an article (Bucerius & Copes 2024) in the American Society of Criminology’s newsletter The Criminologist, outlining their dissent from this policy. It was signed by a number of other international editors from the journal’s board, and argued that the policy change made a series of unacceptable trade-offs between its stated goals (transparency and quality), and several undesirable outcomes, some of which overlapped with those I’ve described today.\nWhat’s particularly interesting is how quickly the debate (which is ongoing— see La Vigne (2025)) moved beyond data publication, to address wider questions of about the relationship between transparency and quality, and whether Open Data, as conventionally understood, was an appropriate frame for this debate. Some contributions (e.g. Greene-Colozzi & Freilich 2024; La Vigne 2025; Young 2024)addressed how the idea of ‘transparency’ should be operationalised by qualitative researchers. Some reaffirmed the value of qualitative and mixed methods, but also offered robust criticisms of how difficult it can be to evaluate qualitative research, because of poor documentation of how it was done.\nEncouragingly, some responses have also engaged constructively with the practical challenges associated with data publication. Jacques & Wheeler (2024) and Dickinson (2024) have explored technical solutions for anonymisation, while Young (2024) and Greene-Colozzi & Freilich (2024) have advocated principles for the documentation of research workflows, and frameworks to balance participant protection with academic accountability.\nWhat’s crucial is that this debate represents some reflection on the kinds of stewardship responsibility which I’ve suggested are incumbent on qualitative researchers. These changes—the shift to digital data, increasing expectations of transparency—are established realities that require constructive engagement. I want to close with a few suggestions about some practical ways forward."

    "text": "Moving from principles to practice \nOne thing that’s important is to understand the landscape better. As I said before, qualitative research is heterogeneous. What do we, and our colleagues, think about open data?\nA recent report originating from the University of Sheffield offers some preliminary, non-representative clues. It found that while many qualitative researchers support openness in principle, they struggle with implementation—particularly around anonymisation and how to negotiate openness while respecting the relationality which goes with qualitative inquiry.\nThe Sheffield team proposed ‘re-renderability’ as an alternative term, to use in place of the more familiar notion of ‘reproducibility’. Like some of the US criminologists, they suggested that transparent analytical processes, better documented interpretive approaches, and rich contextual documentation, could render findings more transparent. They considered these measures to be compatible with data publication, where that is appropriate, but they do not require the publication of data.\nThe Sheffield team’s work also highlighted how we need institutional support to exercise responsible stewardship of qualitative data. This means:\n\nTechnical support for managing sensitive data\nResources to prepare data appropriately\nRecognition for the time this work requires\nSpace for disciplinary communities to develop appropriate approaches\n\nAll of these ideas have implications for how we behave as researchers, and hence there’s a basis for constructive engagement there."

Data is normally digital first, and the idea that there is some relationship between transparency and quality isn’t going away.\nSecond, then, our task is to engage constructively. This might still include declining to publish data.\nThird, instead of asking ‘whose data is it?’, or behaving as if the answer to that question is “ours”, we should ask what responsibilities arise from how our research knowledge came into being. As stewards of our research relationships and the knowledge they generate, we can find ways to honour both our obligations to participants and our commitment to advance knowledge.\nAnd finally, those are conversations which we need to have both within the wider community of those using qualitative, interpretive methods, but also within our disciplines and and faculties.\n[Offer a final note on the UKRI change…]"
